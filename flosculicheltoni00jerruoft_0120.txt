92 THE ANCIENT MARINER.

The wedding-guest sat on a stone :
He cannot choose but hear 3

And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

“The ship was cheer'd‚ the harbour clear'd,
Merrily did we drop,

Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the light-house top.

‘⁴ The sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he Σ v
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea. ‘

“ Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon ’'—

The wedding-guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The bride hath paeed into the hall,
Red as a rose is she 3

Nodding their heads, before her goes
The merry minstrelsy.

The wedding-guest he beat his breast‚
Yet he cannot choose but hear:
And thus spake on that ancient man,

The bright-eyed Mariner.
