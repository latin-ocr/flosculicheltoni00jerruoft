ATALANTA IN CALYDONJ'

ALTHAEA Child, if a man serve law through vall

his life, ‘ ”

And with his whole heart worship, him all gods Ρ

Praise 3 but who loves it only with his lips,

And not' in heart and deed desiring it, ’

Hides a perverse will with obsequiouswords.

Him heaven infatuates, and his twin-born fate

T raoks, and gains on him, scenting sins far off.

Be man at one with equal-minded gods,

So shall he prosper: not through laws torn up,

Violated rule, and a new face of things.

A woman arm’d makes war upon herself,

Unwomanlike‚ and treads down use and wont,

And the sweet common honour that she hath,

Love, and the cry of children, and the hand

Trothplight, and mutual mouth of marriages.

This doth she, being unloved : whom, if one love,

Not fire or iron, and the wide—mouth'd wars, '

Are deadlier than her lips or braided hain
