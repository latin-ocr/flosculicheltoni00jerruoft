208 ESSAv ON MAN.

Nature that tyrant ehecks 3 he only knows,
And helps, another creature's wants and woes.
Say, will the falcon, stooping from above,

Smit with her varying pfflmage, spare the dove?
Admires the jay the insect’s gilded wings?

Or hears the hawk when Philomela sings?

Man cares for all ; to birds he gives his woods,
To beasts his pastures, and to fish his floods;
For some his interest prompts him to provide,
F or, more his pleasure, yet for more his pride:
All seed on one vain patron, and enjoy

The extensive blessing of his luxury.

That very life his learned hunger craves :

He saves from famine, from the savage saves3
N ay, feasts the animal he dooms his feast,

And, till he ends the being, makes it blest 3
Which sees no more the stroke, or feels the pain,
Than favour'd man by touch ethereal slain.

The creature had his feast of life before 3

Thou, too, must perish when thy feast is o'er.

POPE.
