304 THOMAS THE RHYMER.

His ancient wounds their scars expand, - r
With agony his heart is wrung:

O where is Isolde’s lily hand,
And where her soothing tongue? ,

She comes 1 she comes 1—1ike flash of flame
Can lover’s footsteps fly:

She comes! she comes l—she only came
To see her Tristrem die.

’ She saw him die 3 her latest sigh
Join'd in a kiss his parting breath 3
The gentlest pair that Britain bare
United are in death.

There paused the harp-——its lingering sound
Died slowly on the ear3

The silent guests still bent around,
For still they seem’d to hear.

T hen woe broke forth in murmurs weak z
Nor ladies heaved alone the sigh 3

But, half ashamed, the rugged cheek
Did many a gauntlet dry.

On Leader's stream, and Learmont’s tower,
The mists of evening close3

In camp, in casde, or in bower,
Each warrior sought repose.
