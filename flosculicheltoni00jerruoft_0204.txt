MORTE D’ARTH UR.

Bm, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard ·
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King‚

Muttering and murmuring at his ear, “ Quick, quick,

I sear it is too late, and I shall die.''
But the other quickly strode from ridge to ridge,

Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk’d‚

Larger than human on the frozen hills.

He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
Dry clash’d his harness in the icy caves
