does not preserve the original pronunciation, at

high treason, nor (what is often forgotten) ought all
false quantities to be put on the same level of
enormity. But accuracy in these points is surely a

certainly is not to be neglected in days of broad
views and efforts after extensiveness.

It is sometimes objected that the time spent on
verses is disproportionate to the result obtained,
