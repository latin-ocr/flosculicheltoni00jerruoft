 

TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA

ACT 3, Sc, 1. ἢ
VALENTINE. PROTEUS.

VAL. Oh, I have fed upon this woe already,
An'd now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Doth Silvia know that I am banish’d?

Pizo. Ay, ay3 and she hath offer'd to the doom,
(Which, unreversed, stands in effeetual force)
A sea of melting pearL which some call tears:
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd 3
With them upon her knees, her humble sels 3 .
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became

them,

As if but now they waxed pale for woe :
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up, ’
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears‚
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire 3
But Valentine‚ if he be ta'en, must die.
Resides, her intercession chased him so,
