 

100 Two GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.

When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
That to close prison he commanded her,
With many bitter threats of ’biding there.

VAL. No more3 unless the next word that thou
speak’st‚
Have some indignant power upon my life 3
If so, Ι pray thee breathe it in mine ear,
An endless anthem of my endless dolour.

PRO. Cease to lament for that thou canst not
help,

And study help for that which thou lament’st.
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love 3
Resides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
Hope is a lover's staff 3 walk hence with that,
And manage it against despairing thoughts,
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence z
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver’d
E’en in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
The time now serves not to expostulate ε
Come, I'll convey thee through the city gate ε
