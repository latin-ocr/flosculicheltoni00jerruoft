BALDER.

THEY fix'd the mast, and hoisted up the sails,

Then they put fire to the wood 3 and Thor

Set his stout shoulder hard against the stem,

To push the ship through the thick sand: sparks
flew

From the deep trench she plough’d·—so strong a God

F urrow’d„it-and the water gurgled in,

And the ship floated on the waves, and rock’d.

But in the hills a strong east-wind arose,

And came down roaring to the sea: first squalls

Ran black o’er the sea's face, then steady rush’d

The breeze, and fill’d the sails, and blew the fire 3

And, wreath'd in smoke, the ship stood out to sea.

Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire,

And the pile crackled 3 and between the logs

Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out and leapt

Curling and darting higher‚-until they lick’d

The summit of the pile, the dead, the mast,
