.PROMETHEUS. 3 7 5

His was subjection's triumph 3 every vein
Throbb’d with his mighty woes, yet there alone
He stood majestic 3-from his eye disdain‚

F lashing o'er all, would every sigh disown

Which burst his tortured heart, enforcing groan on ”

groan.

Dreary and lonesome is that rocky crest 3
No kindly spring-winds meet the captive's brow,
Nor hath a mortal footstep ever press’d
Those giant heights of ever-during snow,
Which frown defiance on the plain below.
Hark ! mountain torrents through the deep defile
Rush on with endless thunderings, till they flow
To where old Ocean round the rocky pile

In frantie fury breaks, nor keeps his wonted smile.

Noblest of gods, most glorious in thy fall, ”
Prometheus Ξ more than conqueror art thou 3
Since not unanswer’d was oppression's call,
Defeat hath wreathed a glory round thy brow,
Which bay-crown’d Victory would in vain bestow.
Though captive now more honour'd shalt thou be
Than Heaven’s dread tyrant—if before him bow
ImmortaIS‚ 'tis in slavery—to thee

Shall future ages pay their unbought fealty *ἱ

* Prometheus was worshipped by the Colchians as a deity ;

’ and had a temple and high place called T yphaenia Petra

upon mount Caucasus. -Bryant's Mytlzolqg’y.
