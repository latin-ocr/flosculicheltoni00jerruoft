223 BISHOP BRUNo.

Before and behind his soldiers ride,
The people throng’d to see their pride 3

They bow'd the head, and the knee they bent,
But nobody bless'd him as he went.

So he went on stately and proud,
When he heard a voice that cried aloud—

“ Ho 1 ho! Bishop Bruno, you travel with glee,
But I would have you know you travel to me !’'

Behind and before, and on either side,

He look'd, but nobody he espied 3

And the Bishop at that grew cold with sear,
For he heard the words distinct and clear.

And when he rung at the palace bell,
He almost expected to hear his knell 3
And when the porter turn'd the key,
He almost expected Death to see.

But soon the Bishop recover'd his glee,
For the Emperor welcomed him royally z
And now the tables were spread, and there
Were choicest wines and dainty fare.

And now the Bishop had bless’d the meat,
When a voice was heard as he sat in his seat:

ξι( With the Emperor now you are dining with glee‚
But know, Bishop Bruno, you sup with me !'’
