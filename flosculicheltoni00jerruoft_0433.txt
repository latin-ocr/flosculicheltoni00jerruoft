BELISARIUS. 40 5

· But, ministrant on clamorous battle-plains‚
Sated my spirit with a strange delight.

She, leagued in love with the Empress-courtezan‚
Who sway’d the counsels of a glutted spouse,
Whelm'd me in irredeemable disgrace‚

And foul'd the lustre of untarnish'd act,

And 'summon’d me from conquest to despair.
Long 'years I crept through shame unmersted,
Humbled in peace, all glorious in war,—

And mighty only on the battle-field.

At last, when all barbarian multitudes

Rallied upon the Eastern capital,

Justinian call'd me forth from obloquy‚

Like that crisp-pated Quintus from the plough,
And bade me save my country 3 and I went
And chased their armies to the wilderne55‚
And wrought a strong redemption for the land.
He crown'd me with all-noble recompense—
He met slight merit with benign reward—

· He blinded me, and cast me forth to beg—
Poor fool l——or little recking future fame.

‘⁴ Though slowly staggering in the vale of years⁷
I shudder not at that all—victor Death‚
Nor quail at fathomless eternity.
No storied tomb, uprear’d on hero-bones,
No great memorial of greater dead,
Shall signal ruin’d Belisarius.
Yet much Ι joy, seeing my backward years
Loom deep into the dead mist of the Past,
