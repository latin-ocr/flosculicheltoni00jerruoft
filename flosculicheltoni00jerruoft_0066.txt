38 KrNG JOHN.

I shall not know him : therefore, never, never , .
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

PAND. You hold too heinous a respect of grief.. ι
CONST. He talks to me, that never had a son. ’
K. PHI. You are 35 fond of grief as of your child.

CONST. Grief fills the room up of my absent
child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me 3
Puts on his pretty lookg, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form 3
T hen, have I reason to be fond of grief.
Fare you well: had you such 3 1055 35 Ι,
Ι could give better comfort than you do.—
I will not keep this form upon my head,
[staring off lzer head-dress]

When there is such disorder in my wit.
O Lord 1 my boy, my Arthur, my fair son 3
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world,
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows’ cure.

SHAKSPERE.
