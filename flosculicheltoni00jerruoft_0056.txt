TEARS OF SCOTLAND.

Momm, hapless Caledonia, mourn
Thy banish’d peace, thy laurels torn 1
Thy sons, for valour long renown'd‚.

- Lie slaughter⁷d on their native ground ;
Thy hospitable roofs no more

Invite the stranger to the door 3

In smoky ruins sunk they lie,

The monuments of cruelty.

The wretched owner sees afar

His all become the prey of war 3
Bethinks him of his babes and wife,
Then smites his breast, and curses life.
Thy swains are famish'd on the rocks,
Where once they fed their wanton fiocks ,-
ΊἼΊΥ ravish'd virgins shriek in vain,

Thy infants perish on the plain.

What boots it then, in every cume,
Through the wide-spreading waste of time,
Thy martial glory, crown'd with praise,
Stin shone with undiminish'd blaze?
