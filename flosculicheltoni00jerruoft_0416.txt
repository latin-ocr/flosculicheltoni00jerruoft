388 CARTHAGE.

Forlorn, the Eagle in his lonely lair

Unquell'd, undaunted, broods in haught ²¹* despair.

Say, Carthage, thou, whom Nature’s ice-mail’d >wall

Repell'd in vain, nor danger could appal 3

Say wherefore now repose thy victor crest

Enervate, lull’d, on Capua's downy breast.

Strange—that where Death’s e’en deadliest terrors
fail,

Ease gently wins, and Pleasure’s lures avail.

The scene is changed z—lo! Fortune's fitful gale
Now fans the Eagle, wasting fatal bale
To Libya's hapless strand. The bolt of war †, -
All—conqu’ring Scipio, levin-like from far
Ploughs his red track on Zama’s sanguine field,
And Valour's sels to sterner fate must yield.
Farewell to Carthage : o'er her sable bier
There moan’d a hero, stream'd a warrior’s tear ‡ 3
And Virtue to the last could smile to see
In the death— —pyre a balm for slavery§.
Enough——nor foeman' s steel, nor fate, could quell
Her lion soul, till from itself it fell,

²* ‘The haztglzt Northumberland.' ’—H⁷en. VI. Act 3.

† “ ...... geminos, duo fulmina belli,

Scipiadas, cladem Libyae . . . .'' Virg. AEn. vi. 843-4.

Σ Scipio is said to have wept over the ruins of the city,
repeating from Homer the couplet that stands at the head of
this piece.

ξ When all hope of safety was gone, the wife of Hasdrubal,
collecting her matrons around her, lighted a funeral pile in
the temple of AEseulapius, and perished, cursing the treachery
of her husband and his faction.
