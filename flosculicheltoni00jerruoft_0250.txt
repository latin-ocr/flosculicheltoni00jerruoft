222 LADY HERoN’s SONG.

So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,

Among bride’s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers,
and all :

Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword,

(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word‚)

“O come ye in peace here, or corne ye in war,

Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar ?'’

“ Ι long woo’d your daughter, my suit you denied 3-—
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide—
And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.
There are maidens in Scotland, more lovely by far,
T hat would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.''

The bride kiss’d the goblet 3 the knight took it up,
He quaff'd off the wine, and he threw down the cup.
She look’d down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh,
With a smile on her lip, and a tear in her eye.

He took her soft hand, 'ere her mother could bar,
‘⁶ Now tread we a measure‚'' said young Lochinvar.

So stately his form,and so lovely her face,

That never a hall such a galliard did grace 3

While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,

And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet
and plume 3

And the bride-maidens whisper'd, “’Twere better
by far ’

To have match’d our fair cousin with young
Lochinvar.”
