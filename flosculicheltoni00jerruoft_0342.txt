PARADISE LOST

BooK III.

Hm„ holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born ἒ
Or of the Eternal co-eternal bearn,

May I express thee unblamed? Since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light

Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,

Bright effluence of bright essence increate Σ

Or hear’st thou rather pure ethereal stream,

Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the sun,
Before the heavens thou wert 3 and at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest

The rising world of waters dark and deep,

Won from the void and formless infinite.

Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,

Escaped the Stygian DooI, though long detain'd

In that obscure sojourn, while in my ssight,
Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre,

I sang of Chaos and eterna} Night ;

Taught by the heavenly muse to venture down
The dark descent‚ and up to reascend,
