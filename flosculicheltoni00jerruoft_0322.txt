294 FAERIE QUEEN.

There, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found
A little cottage, built of stickes and reedes
In homely wize, and wald with sods around 3
In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weedes
And wilfull, all careless of her needes 3
So choosing solitarie to abide
Far from all neighbours‚ that her divelish deedes
And hellish arts from people she might hide,
And hurt far off unknowne whomever she envide.

The damzell there arriving, entred in,
W here sitting on the flore the hag she found,
Busie (as seem’d) about some wicked gin3
Who, soon as she beheld that suddein stound,
Lightly upstarted from the dustie ground,
And with fell looke‚ and hollow, deadly gaze,
Stared on her awhile, 35 0116 astound,
Ne had one word to speake for great amaze,

But shewd by outward signes that dread her sence
did daze.

At 1351, turning her feare to foolish wrath,
She askt‚ What devill had her thether brought?
And who she was ? and what unwonted path
Had guided her, unwelcomed‚ unsought?
