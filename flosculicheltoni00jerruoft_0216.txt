ROMEO AND JULIET

ACT 3, Sc. α..

NURsE. JULIET.

NL'RSE. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine
eyes,—
God save the mark! here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse 3
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
All in gore blood 3 Ι swounded at the sight.

JUL. O break, my heart l—poor bankrupg break
at once l
To prison, eyes 3 ne’er look on liberty:
Vile earth, to earth resign ; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo, press one heavy bier Σ

NURSE. O Tybalt, Tybalt ! the best friend I had :
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!

That ever I should live to see thee dead ἒ
