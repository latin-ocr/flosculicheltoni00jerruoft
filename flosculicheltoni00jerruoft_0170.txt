142 KING RICHARD ΙΙ.

Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand3
And by the honourable tomb he swears,

That stands upon thy royal grandsire's bones 3
And by the royalties of both your bloodS‚
Currents that spring from one most gracious head 3
And the buried hand of warlike Gaunt 3

And by the worth and honour of himself,
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,—
His coming hither hath no further scope,

Than for his linea] royalties, and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees 3
Which on thy royal party granted once,

His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart

To faithful service of your majesty.

This, swears he, as he is a prince‚ is just 3

And, as I am a gentleman, Ι credit him.

SHAKSPERE.
