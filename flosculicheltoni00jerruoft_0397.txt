GREECE. 369

Scarce had the lowering tempest roll'd away
Ere conquering Greece beheld intestine fray.
Then Discord hover'd round with withering blight,
And pallid Envy gladden'd at the sight.

Inflamed Revenge exhaled his poison’d breath‚
And prompted deeds of cruelty and death.

Sadly the muse would turn th' historic page,

Fain would with brighter themes her song engage‚
Δ Νοι· tell how Athens vainly sought to oppress
Brave Sparta's might and Corinth's haughtiness ;
How in unholy contest warriors bled,

And Grecian blood by Grecian sword was shed.
Oh Ξ veil with silence what ’twere grief to tell 5
Clasp the reeording roll with sorrow's sacred spell.

Long years elapse, long contests intervene‚
And time and war alike have changed the scene.
Athenae’s power had reach'd its noonday height,
And fast was merging in the shades of night.
Thebes had confess'd the Macedonian's sway 3
On Chaeroneia’s plains her warriors lay.

E’en Sparta trembled for her cherish'd name 3
And freedom flicker’d there with languid flame.
'Twas then, impatient for his destined throne,
A sovereign rose 3 in might, in fame—alone 3
Opposing realms beneath his feet he hurl'd,
And shone a meteor o’er the gazing world.

For him had glory deck’d her richest crown,
For him had strew’d the pathway of renown.
Immortal honour graced his kingly brow,

And dazzled memory looks and wonders now.
