THE SACK OF ROME ΒΥ ALARIC. 415

That strange mysterious power, which makes the
thought

Of curse, and pang, and hell, and all beside as
nought.

But all is dark along the tombed way,
Darkness and silence, nor doth any come

In Roman arms their onward march to stay3
And right behind the queenly moon hath

clomb

Through gauzy sheen of mists in bright array,
To glitter on the palaces of Rome.

’ And from the barbarous host upbursts a cheer

To see that now indeed the promised spoil is near.

'Tis midnight‚ and the Eternal City seemeth
A quiet image of eternal sleep 3
Through shadowy groves the breathing zephyrs
creep,
And from a duskier heaven the starlight beameth,
And wide beneath the moon the city dreameth.
And sculptured arch and column’d temple keep
An universal slumber still and deep,
Save where a level flood of splendour streameth
From some high palace hall where revellers
steep,
In glowing streams of purp'e wine,
Their mellow hearts amid the shine
Of incense-breathing lamps, that pour
A golden flood of glory o'er
