1 26 BEDD-GELERT,

Unpleased Llewelyn homeward hied,
When near the portal seat

His truant Gelert he espied‚
Bounding his lord to meet.

But when he gain’d the castle door,
Aghast the chieftain stood :

The hound was smear’d with gouts of gore,
His lips and fangs ran blood.

Llewelyn gazed with wild surprise
Unused such looks to meet 3

His favourite cheek’d his joyful guise,
And crouch'd, and lick'd his feet.

Onward in haste Llewelyn pass'd‚
(And on went Gelert too‚)

And still, where'er his eyes were cast,
Fresh blood-gouts met his view.

O'erturn’d his infant’s bed he found,
The bloodstain'd cover rent,

And all around the walls and ground,
With recent blood besprent.

He call'd his child—no voice replied :
He search’d with terror wild :

Blood-blood he found on every side,
But nowhere found his child.
