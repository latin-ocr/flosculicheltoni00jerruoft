:3 1 0 MACBETH.

A woman's story, at 3 winter's ᾗτε,

Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself Ξ

Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,
You look but on 3 stool.

MACB. Prithee‚ see there Ξ behold ἔ look l 10 Ξ
how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak 100,-
If el1arnel-houses‚ and our graves, must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
'shall be the maws of kites.

LADY M. What! quite unmann’d
in folly?

MACB. If I stand here, I saw him.

LAmr M. F ie, for shame!

MACB. Blood 'hath been shed ere now, i’ the
olden time,

Ere human statute purged the gentle weal 3
Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform’d
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
That when the brains were out the man would die,
And there would end ε but now, they rise again,
With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,
And push us from our stools. This is more strange
Than such 3 murther is.
