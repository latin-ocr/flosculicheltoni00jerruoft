GREECE. , 367

And glow'd reflected on the midnight sky,
Exulting Hellas saw thy glory die.

Years in their rapid circuit onward glide,
And darkly rolls o’er Greece the threatening tide.
See Persia's heralds from their sovereign king
Th’ imperious mandate of submission bring.
‘⁴ And shall , proud Greece the monarch's law

- obey,
Bow to his rule and cringe beneath his sway?
Shall abject Hellas bend before her foeS‚
And wear the setters tyrants would impose Ρ
What though the might of Asia’s myriad band
May pour its fury on our wasted land,
Shall we for life our liberty forego,
Our rights disown and yield them to the foe ?
Heralds‚ return! tell Persia’s haughty lord,
Freedom is ours till conquer'd by the sword 3
Grecia with scorn his-thraldom will deny,
Triumph in glory or in glory die.”
The messengers of war with breathless tread
From West to East the brave defiance spread.
Darius heard—fierce wrath his brow confest,
And deeply vengeance rankled in his breast.
Instant at his command a countless host,
Τὴεε flower of Asia, seek Cilicia's coast3
Thence sail to crush the nation's daring pride
That Persia’s might and Persia's king defied.
And can just Heaven vouchsafe propitious gales?
Or shall gay Victory fill yon snowy sails?

And mid the blaze, that wrapt thy turrets high }
