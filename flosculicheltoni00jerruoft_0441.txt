THE SACK OF ROME ΒΥ ALARIC. 413

Shades of Camillus, Marius, Scipio,
Were ye not wrung with anguish and with shame,
When up the long F laminian Way he came,—
Alaric, Scourge of God—with endless flow
Of barbarous hosts, the Goth, whom none can
tarne, ⁸
And flend-begotten Hun? How fiercely glow
Their wolfish eyes, and still they turn to Rome Ξ
O that some handful of brave souls would come
Of Romans, the old Romans, streaming out
From yonder portals, all athirst for fame
A1id glorious death for Fatherland and home,
And drive this rabble host in headlong rout
Back to the Scythian deserts whence they carne 2

Where are thelegions, and their general—where?
Ο where is Stilicho, who thrice did save
The city in the hour of her despair?
Despair! a hollow echo from the grave
Δ Mutters “ Despair.'' See you by yonder tomb
A tall pale figure standing silent there,
A ghastly spectre upright in the gloom,
Motionless, awful? This is he, the true,
The brave, the noble, star of all the earth,
Stilicho, your deliverer, whom ye slew,
Basely ye slew with treachery and lies Ξ
Ο ingrates‚ madmen Ξ Dreadful are his eyes,
And his white lips are wreath'd in ghastly mirth‚
For well he wots ere morrow’s sun can rise
All Rome shall reek to grace his obsequies
