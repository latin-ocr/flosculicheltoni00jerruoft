PREFACE. 'xv

7 It'requires‘that a boy shall be able to distinguish
between the ideas of the original, which must be
preserved, and the peculiarities of 'language and
colouring, which must be altered. To seize firmly
the essential point and beauty of a passage, while at
the same time he clothes its idea in different idiom
and form,—to catch moreover something of that
peculiar spirit which belongs to classical poetry,
learning thereby to discern what is essentially
modern in thought, and incapable of actual trans-
lation, vthough inviting the substitution of some

true Classical equivalent-all this, which is involved ,

in any good Verse Composition, seems to me no
indifferent training, either of thought or taste. ’

Nor is it altogether unworthy of notice, that such
composition necessitates the cultivation os the terse-
neSS, antithesis, and distinctness of expression, in
respect of which the Prose Composition of young
beginners, either in their own language or in any
other, is often peculiarly deficient. Especially,
Ι think, is this the case with the Latin Elegiac
couplet, and the Greek Iambic verse. In fact
the latter seems to be a kind of “ glorified ” prose,
in which all the highest qualities of prose-writing
are preserved, and animated by a somewhat higher
spirit.
