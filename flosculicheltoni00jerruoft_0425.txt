THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

, Nearer steals the music—nearer:
Hark! it strikes upon the ear:

Nations, Labour speaketh! hear her! ¹

‘⁶ I am coming! I arn here 1
I have been where go'lden rivers
Gleaming roll o’er golden sand :
I have been where ocean severs
Man from man and land from-land ε
Wandering on through forest-alleys
And the shadowy greenwood-aisle,
Ι have sped o’er Europe's valleys‚
Cross’d the desert, track’d the Nile——
Asia opes her portals to me—
China is untrod no more—-
Through Siberia’s deserts gloomy
Pass I on to Labrador.
And the New World lies before me,
Track I on through forest trees
And a sound comes floating o’er me
With the whisper of the breeze ε
’Tis the sound of Labour! slowly
Sweeps the axe with measured blow,
And the stricken tree bends lowly—
Boweth lower—falleth low Ξ
Cheerly then spake I : ‘ Ye nations,
Hither! lay at Labour's shrine
Choicest works and best oblations

From the mountain and the mine l’ ’'
