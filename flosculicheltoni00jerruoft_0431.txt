BELISARIUS. 403

And wrought themselves an everlasting name,
When all the corse-piled plain was pale with death—
Or they who, martyrs to their fatherland,
Champions of Europe, glory of old Greece,

Fail'd from the battle-shout at Salamis,

Sank in the shadows of Thermopylae.

‘⁴ Then‚ when a strife arose in Africa,
And, red in battle first-fruits‚ leapt the war,
And great Justinian sent his choicest troops,
And me, his choicest General,—I went,
I fought, I conquer'd 3 I deserved my honour—-
Not less than he who once upon a time,
In those dim years of the great-storied past,
Stept on the surge-struck Carthaginian shores,
And drew her soul from the Phoenician queen,
And left her weltering on a funeral pyre,
*And rooted out the pristine Latian tribeS,
And was the founder of a royal race 3
A race whose deeds shall sound throughout the

world,

While the sun flames and the great waters roll,
And the wind roars from unknown solitudeS,
And the strong mountains on their base endure 3
Or he who, lusty in the lusty prime
Of Roman valour, razed the city gates
And blotted Carthage from the nation-roll,
And wrought for Rome a priceless victory.

“ I, conqueror on the throne of Africa,
