148 wrrcn OF FYFE.

The warlock men and the weird wemynge,
And the says of the wood and the steep‚

And the phantom hunteris all war there,
And the mermaids of the deep.

And they washit us all with the witch-water‚ ‚
Distillit fra the muirland dew,

Quhill our beauty blumit like the Lapland rose,
That wyld in the foreist grew.

“ Ye lee l ye lee ! ye ill womyne‚
Sae loud as I heir ye lee 1

For the warst-faurd wife on the shoris of Fyfe ¹
Is cumlye comparit with thee.'’

Then the mermaidis sang and the woodlandis rang,
Sae sweetly swellit the quire 3

On every cliffe aherpe they hang,
On every tree' a 'lyre.

And aye they sang and the woodlandis rang,
And we drank and we drank sae deep :

Then soft in the armis of the warlock men
We laid us dune to sleep.

“ Away, away, ye ill womyne‚
An ill deide met ye dee Ξ

Quhan ye hae pruvit se false to yer God
Ye can never pruve true to me.⁷'
