1 80 MORTE 'D’ARTHUR

But she, that rose the tallest of thern all

And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,

And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chased his
hands,

And call’d him by his name, complaining loud

And dropping bitter tears against his brow

Striped with dark blood : for all his face was white

And colourless, and like the wither’d moon

Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east3

And all his greaves and cuisses dash’d with drops

Of onset3 and the light and lustrous curls—

That made his forehead like a rising sun

High from the da'is throne—were parch'd with dust 3

Or clotted into points and hanging loose,

Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.

So like a shatter'd column lay the King 3

Not like that Arthur, who, with lance at rest,

From spur to plume a star of tournament,

Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged

Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.

TENstoN.
