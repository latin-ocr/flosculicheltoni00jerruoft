TITHONUS.

Avi: me 1 aye me 1 the woods decay and fall,
The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,
Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,
And after many a summer dies the Swan.

Me only cruel immortality

Consumes ι Ι wither slowly in thine arms,

Here at the quiet limit of the world,

A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream
The ever-silent spaces of the East, ·

Far folded mists‚ and gleaming halls of Morn.
Aias 1 for this grey shadow‚ once a man—

So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,

W ho madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd

To his great heart none other than a God ἕ

’ Ι ask'd thee, “ Give me immortality.'’

Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,
Like wealthy men who care not how they give.
But thy strong Hours indignant work’d their wills‚
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,
And though they could not end rne, left me maim'd
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,
