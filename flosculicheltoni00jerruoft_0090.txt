62 HvMN ON THE SEASONS.

And let me catch it as I muse along.

Ye headlong torrents, rapid and profound,—

Ye softer floods, that lead the humid maze

Along the vale,—and thou, majestic main,

A secret world of wonders in thyselfi—

Sound His stupendous praise, whose greater voice

Or bids you roar, or bids your roarings fall.

Soft-roll your incense, herbs, and fruits, and flowers,

In mingled clouds to Him whose sun exalts,

Whose breath perfumes you, and ‚whose pencil
paints 3

Ye forests, bend, ye harvests, wave, to Him 3

Breathe your still song into the reaper’s heart,

As home he goes beneath the joyous moon.

Ye that keep watch in heaven, as earth asleep

Unconscious lies z effuse your mildest beams,

Ye constellations, while your angels strike‚

Amid the spangled sky, the silver lyre :

Great source of day 1 best image here below

Of thy Creator, ever pouring wide,

From world to world, the vital ocean round,

On Nature write with every beam His praise.

The thunder rolls ε be hush'd the prostrate world 3

While cloud to cloud returns the solemn hymn,

Bleat out afresh, ye hills 3 ye mossy rocks,

Retain the sound 3 the broad responsive low,

Ye valleys, raise z for the Great Shepherd reigns,

And His unsuffering kingdom yet will come.

Ye woodlands all, awake: a boundless song
