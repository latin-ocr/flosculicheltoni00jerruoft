KING RICHARD II

ACT 3, Sc. 2.
KING RICHARD. BISHOP. AUMERLE.

R1CH. I⁴ weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom Once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
T hough rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs :
As a long—parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her team, and smiles in meeting ;
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favour with my royal hands,
F eed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense ;
But let thy spfflers, that suck up thy venom,
v And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way 3
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,
Which with usurping steps do trample thee :
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies 3
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder 5
