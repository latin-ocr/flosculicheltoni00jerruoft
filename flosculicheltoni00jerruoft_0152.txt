BEDD-GELERT.

THE spearman heard the bugle sound‚
And cheerly smiled the mom,

’ And many a brach, and many a bound,

ζ Attend Llewelyn's horn.

And still he blew a louder blast,
And gave a louder cheer3

‘⁴ Come, Gelert 3 why art thou the last
Llewelyn’s horn to hear?

⁵⁶ Oh, where does faithful Gelert roam,
The flower of all his raoe,

So true, so brave 3 a lamb at home,
A lion in the chase? ''

That day Llewelyn little loved
The chase of hart or hare,

And scant and small the booty proved,
For Gelert was not there.
