LADY HERON’S SONG.
, (Mamm.)

OH ἒ young Lochinvar is come out of the west 3
Through all the wide border his steed was the best ;
And save his good broadsword he weapon had none ς
He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone.

So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,

There never was Knight like the young Lochinvar.

He stay'd not for brake, and he stopp’d not for
stone,

He swam the Eske river where ford there was none 3
But ere he alighted at Netherby gatte,

The bride had consented, the gallant came late 3
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,

Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
