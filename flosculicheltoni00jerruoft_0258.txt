2 30 . BISHOP BRUNO.

The Bishop then grew pale with affrig'ht,

And suddenly lost his appetite 3

Not all the wine, nor the dainty cheer,

Could comfort his heart that was siek with sear.-

But by little and little recover’d he,
For the wine went flowing merrily 3
Till at length he forgot his former dread,
And his cheeks again grew rosy red.

When he sat down to the royal fare . ἢ
Bishop Bruno was the saddest man there,
But when the masquers enter'd the hall,
He was the merriest man of all.

Then from amidst the masquers' crowd,

There went a voice hollow and loud z

“ You have pass'd the day, Bishop Bruno, in glee,
But you must pass the night with me.’'

His cheeks grow pale, and his eye-balls glare,
And stiff round his tonsure bristles his hair 3

With that there came one from the masquers’ band,
And took the Bishop by the hand.

The bony hand suspended his breath,

His marrow grew cold at the touch of Death 3
On saints in vain he attempted to call,
Bishop Bruno fell dead in the palace hall 1
