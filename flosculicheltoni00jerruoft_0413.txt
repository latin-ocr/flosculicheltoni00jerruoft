CARTHAGE. 38 5

The head of warrior steed *—prophetic sign 1
Portentous bodement of the powers divine,

That thus Carchedon's fiery sons should be

The pride and flower of Afric‘s chivalry ἕ

Νοι· did her sword, her sceptre's haughty sway,
Forswear the promise of her elder day ε

Ne'er valour fail’d in bold relies to show

Each airy sketch Ambition’s pencil drew ;

Her fondest, wildest dreams to realize

Of conquest, fame, and lofty enterprise.

Bear witness, Rome, thy shield's oft-tarnish'd sheen
Attest it, Trebia, Cannae, Thrasymene3

Lo Ξ Carthage pours her stranger myriads forth,—
The South commingling with the grisly North—
Here Vandal‚ Visigoth, and fiery Hun 3

There AEthiop’s child, Numidia's swarthy son :
And every race‚ and every hue unite

In one dark confluence of angry might.

But who the chief that sways this lawless train—
The master—spirit they oppose in vain-—

That spells the crowd, and with commanding skill
Moulds their fierce tempers to his sovereign will ?
Hark! a loud note peals forth the trump of fame,
And wond’ring ages echo back thy name,

’Mid peers still peerless ! glorious in thy fall 1
Spoilt child of vict’ry ἒ deathless Hannibal 1

So torrents streaming from a thousand hills,

The monster progeny of countless rills‚

* Virg. AEn. i. 442 sqq.
