348 TITHONUS.

Immortal age beside immortal youth,
And all I was in ashes,

Can thy love,
Thy beauty make amends, though even now.
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears
To hear me? Let me go : take back thy gift.
Why should a man desire in any way
To vary from the kindly race of men,
Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance,

Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?
A soft air fans the cloud apart 3 there comes
A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.

Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals
From thy pure brom, and from thy shoulders pure
And bosom beating with a heart renew'd.

Thy cheek begins to redden through the gloom‚
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine

Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team>
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke arise

And shake the darkness from their loosen’d manes,
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.

TENNYSON.
