KING RICHARD II

ACT 2, Sc. 1.

KING RICHARD. JOHN OF GAUNT.

K. RICH. Can sick men play thus nicely with
their names?

GAUNT. No Ξ misery makes sport to mock itself.
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.

RICH. Should dying men flatter with those that
live?

GAUNT. No, n03 men living flatter those that
die.

RICH. Thou, now a-dying, say’st thou fiatter'st
me.

GAUNT. Oh no! thou diest, though I the sicker
be.

RICH. I am in health‚'1 breathe‚ and see thee
ill.
