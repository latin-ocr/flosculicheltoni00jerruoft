96 THE ANCIENT MARINER.

“ And a good south wind sprung up behind :
The Albatross did follow,

And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariner’s hollo Ξ

“ In mist or cloud, or mast or shroud,
It perch'd for vespers nine 3

While all the night, through sog-smoke white,
Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.’'

“ God save thee, ancient Mariner!
From the fiends that plague thee thus Ξ
Why look’st thou so ?''—“ With my &oss-bow
Ι shot the Albatross.”
