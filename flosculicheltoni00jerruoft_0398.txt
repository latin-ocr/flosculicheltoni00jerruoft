3 70 GREECE.

Wide o'er the East he raised his mighty hand,

And Asia yielded to his proud command.

In vain luxurious Tyre his sway denied‚

Nor wealth could save her, nor empurpled pride. Ι .

To Egypt next his fearless troops he led,

And the still desert heard their elanging tread.

F resh conquests lure him 3 e’en on Indus’ stream

His distant arms magnificently gleam.

Still burn'd Ambition in his bosom's core,

He gain'd new triumphs and still sigh'd for more.

His hopes to blest Arabia's empire rise‚

And gorgeous visions flit before his eyes.

Alas 1 the arm of Death his course hath stay’d‚

And in the silent tomb the monarch laid.

With him, O Greeoe, thy latest glory died ;

With him was sepulchred thy lingering pride. ¹

Empress of N ations 1 fallen is thy might 3

Thy sun, alas, hath set in dreary night Σ

ΤὴὲςοΙᾶεη rays that once illumed thy land

Have beam'd on other elimes at Heaven's com-
mand.

No longer now the shouts of Triumph rise,

Nor lofty paeans fill the echoing skies 1

The festal crowd no longer wends its way

’ Olympia's solemn pageant to survey.

No laurel ohaplet binds the victor’s brow 3

Applause is hush'd, and all is silent now.

And ye, proud sanes, once bright with votive gold,

Where gods were shrined and heaven’s decrees
foretold‚
