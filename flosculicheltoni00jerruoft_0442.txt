414 THE SACK OF ROME ΒΥ ALARIC.

But as a gloomy bastion'd thunder-cloud‚
Driven by the raging tempest, sweeps along,
To where some hoary monster peak doth shroud
His giant shoulders, and the murky throng
Press on to burst in thunders echoing loud3
So moved the Goth, and led the barbarous crowd,
And that strange sever raging in his breast,
Which spurr’d him on like madness through the
long ’
DiSastrous years of struggle and unrest, ⁴
Goading him still to Rome, is yet as strong
As when he burst in deluge upon Greece, ⁸
And left her desert. Yea, when all was lost,
Even then it burn’d as though it ne'er would cease,
Driving him on, till once again a host
Innumerable served him, and his name
Sounded abroad3 but that old enemy cross’d
His path of destiny‚ and dimm'd his fame,
And rescued Rome, and marr’d his hope of peace.

But Stilicho low lieth in the tomb,
And who shall save the city? See, they come
Host upon host, and Alaric leads them on,
And that fire burneth till the goal is won.
O holy hermit, cease, thy words are vain,

Nor prayer, nor bitter curse, nor threaten’d hell
Can check the loosen'd torrent, or restrain

The smoking avalanche! Think not thou to

quell
