WHITE DOE OF RYLSTONE.

High-ribb'd vault of stone, or cell
Withperfect cunning framed as well

Of stone, and ivy, and the spread

Of the elder’s bushy head :

Some jealous and forbidding cell,

That doth the living stars repel,

And where no flower hath leave to dwess.

The presence of this wandering doe ·

. F ills many a damp obscure recess

With lustre' of a saintly show3
And, re-appearing, she no less
Sheds on the flowers that round her blow
A more than sunny loveliness.

But hers are eyes serenely bright,
And on she moves, with pace how light!
Nor spares to stoop her head, and taste
The dewy turs with flowers bestrown 3
And thus she fares, until at last ’
Beside the ridge of a grassy grave
In ‘quietness she lays her down'3 -
Gently as a weary wave
Sinks, when the summer breeze hath died,
Against an anchor’d vessel’s side ;

Even so, without distress‚ doth she
Lie down in peace, and lovingly.

WORDSWORTH.
