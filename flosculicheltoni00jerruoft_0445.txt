‚THE SACK or ROME ΒΥ ALARIC. 417

Where all the rifled tropics bloom,
And all that clustereth loveliest,

From balmy East to emerald West,

In crystal laves its flowery tresses,
And there the night-bird hath her nest,
And odorous blossoms droop' in rest.

The music saints, dissolved in ecstasies 3
The music droops its languid wings and dies ;
But Heaven above, with all his myriad eyeS‚
Glitters in breathless silence, and around
In moonlit calm the shadowy city lies,
The charmed city sleeps without a sound.

But through the stillness, sudden, wild, and high,
From Gothic trumpet peals an awful blare,
And echoes shrilly through the shuddering air,

With barbarous yells and shrieks of them that die,
And far and wide the direful torches flare,

With crash of ruins falling thunderously3

And reddening far into the troubled sky
From blazing cedar gleams a ghastly giare 3

And from the city swells an echoing cry,—

A shriek of multitudinous agony,

A wail of terror, anguish‚ and despair!

Even as a sailor in the northern night,

When all the waves are hush'd in silver sleep,
Lying becalm'd upon the moonlit deep,

Sees far away a giant iceberg shine
