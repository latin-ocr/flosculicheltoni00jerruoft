H IAWATHA.

Of the south wind in the tree-tops,
Said he, “ O my Hiawathal

All your prayers are heard in Heaven,
For you pray not like the others,

Not for greater skill in hunting‚

Not for greater craft in fishing,

Not for triumph in the battle,

Nor renown among the warriors,

But for profit of the people‚

For advantage of the nations.

From the Master of Life descending,
Ι, the friend of man, Mondamin,
Come to warn you and instruct you
How, by struggle and by labour,

You shall gain what you have pray'd for.
Rise up from your bed of branches‚
Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me.’'
F aint with famine, Hiawatha

Started from his bed of branches‚
From the twilight of his wigwam
Forth into the fiush of sunset

Came, and wrestled with Mondamin.
At his touch he felt new courage
Throbbing in his hrain and bosom,

F elt new life and hope and vigour
Run through every nerve and fibre.
So they wrestled there together,

In the glory of the sunset ;

And the more they strove and struggled
