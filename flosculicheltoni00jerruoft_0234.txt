206 Essm( ON MAN.

All served‚ all serving3 nothing stands alone ;
The chain holds on, and where it ends, unknown.

Has God, thou fool Ξ work’d solely for thy good,
Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food?
Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn,

For him as kindly spreads the flowery lawn z
Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings?

Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings.

Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat?
Loves of his own and raptures swell the note.
The bounding steed you pompously bestride‚
Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride.
Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain?
The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain.
Thine the full harvest of the golden year?

Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer.
The hog, that ploughs not, nor obeys thy call,
Lives on the labours of this lord of all.

Know, nature's children all divide her care 3
The fur that warms a monarch warm'd a bear.
While man exclaims‚ “See all things for my use !”
‘⁴ See man for mine 1'' replies a pamper’d goose z
And just as short of reason must he fall,

Who thinks all made for man, not one for all.

Grant that the powerful still the weak control 3
Be man the wit and tyrant of the whole:
