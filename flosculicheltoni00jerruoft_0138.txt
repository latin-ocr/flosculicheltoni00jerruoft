110 KING RICHARD II.

Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords 3
This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king

Shall salter under foul rebellious arms.

B1SHOP. Fear not, my lord 3 that Power that
made you king,
Hath power to keep you king, in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected3 else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven’s offer we refuse 3
The proffer'd means of succour and redress.

AUM. He means, my lord, that we are too
remiss 3
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great, in substance and in friends.

RICH. Discomfortable cousin 1 know’st thou not,
’ T hat when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Behind the globe, and lights the lower world ;
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen,
