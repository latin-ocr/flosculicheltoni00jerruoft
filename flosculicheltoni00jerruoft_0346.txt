LAODAMIA.

THE Gods to us are merciful ;—and they
Yet further may relent 3 for mightier far
Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway
Of magio potent over sun and star,
Is love, though oft to agony distress’d,
And though his favourite seat be feeble Woman's
breast.

But if thou goest, Ι follow—Peme! he said—-

She look’d upon him and was calm’d and cheer’d 3
The ghastly colour from his lips had fied 3

In his deportment‚ shape‚ and mien‚ appear'd
Elysian beauty‚ melancholy grace,
Brought from a pensive though a happy place.

He spake of love, such love as spirits feel
In worlds whose course is equable and pure 3
No fears to beat away—no strife to heah-
The past unsigh’d for, and the future sure 3
Spake of heroic arts in graver mood
Revived, with finer harmony pursued.
