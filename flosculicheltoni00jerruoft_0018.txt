xvi PREFACE.

I do not believe that Verse Composition either
ought to be, or need be (as has been said), a
“tessellation’' of passages, copied from Classical
authorS, and servilely applied. There are those,
who will copy without judgment or discretiori in*
this, as in every thing else. But, as a matter of fact,
the verses of any Sixth Form boy have as true an
impress of individuality‚ as any other work that he
does. We cannot expect, I am not sure whether
we ought to desire, that the work of a boy of
sixteen or seventeen should be in all points original
in spirit The attempt to make it so is often a
stram, Which.the immature mind is not ready to
bear. But, if verses are allowed to be a mere
collection of borrowed prettinesses, the fault lies
not in the composition in itself, but in the manner
of teaching and of writing it.

Nor can I doubt that Verse Composition, even
when it has no great power of its own, does foster
some appreciation of poetic beauty, not perhaps of
the highest beauty—the beauty of thought—but of
the lower beauty of graceful and picturesque ex*
pression. There will be exceptions, glaring excep-2
tions, to the rule here as elsewhere3 but I speak
merely of the average result. It is something to
have even a vague idea that an expression may sin
