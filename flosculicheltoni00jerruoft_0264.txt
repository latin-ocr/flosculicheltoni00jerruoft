ROMEO AND JULIET

ACT 4, Sc. 1.
JULIET. FRIAR.

JUL. O bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower3
Or walk in thievish ways 3 or bid me lurk
Where serpents are 3 chain me with foaring bears 3
Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls 3
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
Or hide me with a dead man in his shroud 3
Things that to hear thern told have made me

tremble‚

And I will do it without sear or doubt,
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.

FmAR. Hold then, go home, be merry‚ give
consent
To marry Paris 3 Wednesday is to-morrow 3
