3 7 6 PROMETH Eos.

For thou didst love mankind 3 they were to thee
As friends whom suffering strove in vain to part :
Helpless, deserted, oh thou could'st not see
Them pine in loneliness, each bosom smart
Beneath Neglect's cold frown, but beat thine heart
With love to be the champion of their woes:
With liberal hand thou gav’st them every art ς
Lo 1 new-born Knowledge triumph'd o’er her foes,
And 011 the darkling night the morn of Science rose.

Glorious it rose, but oh! its earliest ray

Shone but too plainly on thy glory's fall 3

And as it brighten’d into radiant day,

Beheld thee bound beneath a tyrant's thrall

In adamantine chains3 could these appal

The heaven-born sternness of thy Titan 110311.>

Nay, noble spirit, nor would’st thou recal

One deed of thine that made thee what thou art,
For all the joys that Heaven and Freedom could

impart.

And yet the end is not, for o’er his head

Ages shall roll, yet roll, alas! in vain3

‚He lives immortal, nor shall Time e'er shed

His hoary honours round that brow, nor train

Reluctant thought to smile on endless pain 3

Yet for no crime but love does he atone z

Yes 1 ’twas Love’s self that forged the fatal chain

That binds to earth her own, her favourite son,
And keeps him there a captive, time-doom’d‚ and

alone.
