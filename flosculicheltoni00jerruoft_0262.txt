2 34 BALDER.

And ate the shrivelling sails : but still the ship
Drove on, ablaze above her hull with fire.

And the Gods stood upon the beach and gazed :
And, while they gazed, the sun went lurid down
Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on.
Then the wind fell, with night, and there was‘calm.
But through the dark they watch'd the buming ship,
Still carried o'er the distant waters on

F urther and further, like an eye of fire.

And as in the dark night a travelling man

Who bivouacs in a forest ’mid the hills,

Sees suddenly a spire of flame shoot up

Out of the black waste forest, far below,
Which'woodcutters have lighted near their lodge -
Against the wolves 3 and all night long it flares :—
So flared in the far darkness Balder's pyre.

But fainter, as the stars rose high, it burn'd 3

The bodies were consumed, ash choked the pile-2
And as in> a decaying winter fire

A charr’d log falling makes a shower of speaks,—
So with a shower of sparks the fire fell in,
Reddening the sea around‚ and all was dark. ..
