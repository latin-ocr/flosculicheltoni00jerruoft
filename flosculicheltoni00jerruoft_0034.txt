6 F1Rs'r PART OF KING HENRY vl.

BUR. I am vanquish’d 3 these haughty words of
hers

Have batter'd me like roaring cannon shot,

And made me almost yield upon my knees—
Forgive me country, and sweet countrymen 1⁷

And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:

My forces and my power of men are yours 3

So farewell‚ Talbot 3 I'll no longer trust thee.

SHAKSPERE.
