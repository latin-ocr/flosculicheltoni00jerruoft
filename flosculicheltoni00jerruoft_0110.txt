82 PARADISE Los‘r.

Eternity, so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate 1 Let us not then pursue
By force impossible, by leave obtain'd
Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state
Of splendid vassalage 3
But rather seek
Our own good from ourselves, and from our own
Live to ourselves, though in this vast receSS,
Free, and to none accountable, preferring
Hard liberty before the easy yoke
Of- servile pomp. Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,
We can create, and in what place soe’er
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
T hrough labour and endurance. This deep world
Of darkness do we dread Ρ How oft amidst
Thick cloud and dark doth Heaven’s all-ruling Sire
Choo'se to reside, his glory unobscured,
And with the maJesty of darkness round
Covers his throne 3 from whence deep thunders roar,
Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell?
As he our darkness, cannot we his light
Imitate when we please? This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustre‚ gems and gold,
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise
