And thy life history.’'-—And the old man smiled:
As some faint meteor in the pale-starr'd even ’
Gleams from the heavens on a joyless tract,—

A tract of wide waste lands, and solitary‚

Save beasts that howl beneath a cloud-wrapt night,
And reddens for a moment, and is gone 3

And the wind moans, and the far bittern booms,
And the reeds shiver, and the marsh-fed willows
Sway their lank arms awhile, and all is still :

So gleam’d a smile across his haggard face,

A smile that only lit his desolation.

Smiling, he sigh'd 5 “So soon, so soon forgot?
Yet not for ever, for I know the end.

But I will tell thee all things from the first-—

“ As erst the many—fountain’d vaults of heaven
Burst open on a world of giant sin,
So from far frost-bound regions of the North
Rush’d the barbarians on the Roman world,
Came wolfish VandaI, came cold-stunted Hun,
Came Alaric‚ scourge of God, scourging a land
Of Roman majesty and Roman crime :
And that great ancient Empire of the West
Fell-and the Eastern rock’d upon its base—
Till I arose, a Saviour in the land,
Warrior by nature, peasant monarch-sought:
I saved my country— and I beg my bread.

Thrace was my birth-place—champaign heaven-
blest,

Rich in broad water, rich in swelling crag,
