172 GONDOLINE.

But now a pale blue light she saw,
It from a distance came 3

She follow⁷d‚ till upon her sight,
Burst full a flood of flame.

She stood appall’d 3 yet still the charm
Upheld her sinking soul 3

Yet each bent knee the other smote‚
And each wild eye did roll.

And such a sight as she saw there,
No mortal saw before,

And such a sight as she saw there,
No mortal shall see more.

A burning cauldron stood in the midst,
The flame was fierce and high,

And all the eave, so wide and long,
Was plainly seen thereby.

And round about the cauldron stout
Twelve wither’d witehes stood,

Their waists were bound with living snakes,
And their hair was stiff with blood.

Their hands were gory too, and red,
And fiercely flamed their eyes 3
And they were muttering indistinct

Their hellish mysterieS.
