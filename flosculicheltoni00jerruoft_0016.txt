xiv·- PREFACE.

book is not to be compared with such works as the
‘² Sabrinae Corolla‚” which contain the best speci-
mens of School Exercises on short selected passages
For it is clear that a long Prize Composition must
be judged as a whole ; and that it is not easy to
maintain in it so high a standard of excellence,as
may be attained in a short composition, on which
the translator’s whole attention-is concentrated ·

Its publication happens to take place at a time,
when public opinion appears somewhat unfavourable
to· verse-writing as such, and when able men are
found to declare, that compositions such as those
v,herelprinted are a hindrance‚ rather than a help,-
to real culture of the mind. But I doubt whether
this opinion, which marks a reaction against the
excessive value formerly attached to Composition‚-
both in School and University Examinations, will
really stand the test of time and reflection. Many,
if not all, the objections on which it is based apply
almost exclusively to original Verse Composition‚·

· the use of which should certainly be far more

restricted, than that of translation. And, when *we
consider the nature of the mental process involved

in the rendering of a passage of English Poetry
into Latin or Greek Verse, I think its value can
hardly be questioned.
