202 LAMENT FOR JAMES, EARL OF GLENCAIRN.

Why did I live to see that day?
A day to me so full of woe l

Oh Ξ had I met the mortal shaft
Which laid my benefactor low!

‘⁴ The bridegroom may forget the bride

Was made his wedded wife yestreen 3
The monarch may forget the crown

T hat on his head an hour has been z

. The mother may forget the child

That smiles sae sweetly on her knee 3
But I'll remember thee, Glencairn,

And a’ that thou hast done for me 1 ''

ΑΒυιζΝε.
