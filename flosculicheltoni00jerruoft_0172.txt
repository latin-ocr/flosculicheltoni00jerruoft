WITCH OF FYFE.

THE second nyeht quhan the new moon set,
O'er the roaring sea we flew 3

The cockle-shell our trusty bark,
Our sailis of the grein sea-rue.

And the bauld windis blew‚ and the fire-flauchtis
flew,
And the sea ran to the skie 3
And the thunner it growlst, and the sea-dogs howlst,
As we gaed scouryng bye.

And aye we mountit the sea-grein hillis,
Quhill we brushit thro' the cludis of the hevin ;
Than sousit dounright like the stern-shot light,
Fra the listis blue casement driven.

But our taiekil stood, and our bark was good,
And sae pang was our pearily prow,

Quhan we culdna speil the brow of the wavis,
We needilit them throu below.
