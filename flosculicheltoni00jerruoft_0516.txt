Mr. Green's “A charnians (md ngrlzts '' of Aristophanen -« ¹ γ’

“The Editors of this Series have under-
taken the task os issuing texts of all the
authors commonly read, and illustrating
them with an* English Commentary, com-
pendious as well as clear. If the future
volumes fulfil the promise of the Pro-
spectus as well as those already published‚
the result will be a very valuable work.
The excellence of the prmt, and the care
and pains bestowed upon thegeneral getting
up, form a marked contrast to the school-
books of our own day. Who does not
remember the miserable German editions of
classical authors in paper covers, execrably
printed on detestable paper, which were
thought amply good enough for the school-
boys of the last generation? A greater
contrast to these can hardly be imagined
than is presented by the Calena C lassi-
corum. Nor is the improvement only
external: the careful revision of the text,
and the notes, not too lengthy and con-
fused, but well and judiciously selected,
which are to be found in every page, add
considerably to the value of this Edition,
which we may safely predict will soon be
an established savourite, not only among
Schoolmasters‚ but at the Universities.
The volume before us contains the first part
of an Edition of Aristophanes, which com-
prises the Acharnians and the Knjghts, the
one first in order, and the other the most
famous of the plays of the great Athenian
Satirist.’'—Clzurckman‚ May 23, 1867.

“The utmost care has been taken with
this Edition of the most sarcastic and elever

of the old Greek dramatists, facilitating*
the means of understanding both the text
and intention of that biting sarcasm which
will never lose either point or'interest‚ and
is as well adapted to the present age as it
was to the times when first· ut forward.'’-
Bell’s Weekly Messenger, une 8, 1867.

‘⁴ The advantages conserred on the learner
by these compendious aids can only be pro-
perly estimated by those who had experi-
ence os the mode of study years ago. The
translated passages and the notes, while
sufficient to assist the willing learner, cannot
be regarded in any sense assa cram-'’—
C lem'cal Journal, June 6, 1867.

“Mr. Green has discharged his part of
the work with uncommon skill and ability.
The notes show a thorough study of the
two Plays, an inde endent judgment in the
interpretation of tliie poet, and a wealth of ,
illustrat10n‚ from whichthe Editor draws
whenever it is necessary. ''—Museum, June,
1867.

“ Mr. Green presumes the· existence of a
fair amount of scholarship in all who read
Aristophanes, as a study of his works
generally succeeds to some considerable
knowledge of the tragic poets. 'The notes
he has appended are therefore brief, perhaps
a little too brief. We should say the ten—
dency of most modern editors is rather the
other way ; but Mr. Green no doubt knows ¹
the class for which he writes, and has been
careful to supply their wants.'’—Spectator‚

July 27, 1867.

M r. Simcox’s Juvenal.

“Of Mr. Simcox’s ‘Juvenal’ we can
only speak in terms of the highest com-
mendation‚ as a simple, unpretending wo'rk,
admirably adapted to the wants of the
school-boy or of a college passman. It is
clear, concise, and scrupulously honest in
shirkingmo real difficulty. The pointed
epigrammatic hits of the satirist are every
where well brought out, and the notes really
are what they profess to be, explanatory in
the best sense of the ⁴term.''——London
Review, September 28, 1867.

“This is a link in the catena Classi-
corum to which the attention of our readers
has been more than once directed as a good
Series of Classical works sor School and
College purposeS. The Introduction is a
very comprehensive and able account of
Juvenal, his satires, and the manuscripts.'’
—A thenaeum, October 5, 1867. ”

“This is a very original and enjoy-
able Edition of one of our savourite
classics.'' — Spectator, November 16,
18‘6‘7Every class of readers,·— those who use
Mr. Simcox as their sole interpreter, and
those who supplement larger editions by
his conci, matter,-—will alike find interest
and care ul research in his able preface.
This indeed we should call the reat feature
os his book. The three facts w ich sum up
Juvenal's history so far as we know it are
soon despatched ; but the internal evidence
both as to the dates of his writing and
publishing his Satires, and as to his cha-
racter as a writer, voccu y some fifteen
or twenty pages, which wili repay method-
ical study.''—Cl1urchman, December 11,

1867.
