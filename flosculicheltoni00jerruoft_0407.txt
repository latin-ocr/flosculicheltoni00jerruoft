PROMETHEUS. 3 79

But now the lightning cleaves its lurid path,
In flashing vengeance through the sable stole
That curtains day from earth 3 in sleepless
· wrath‚
Booming from crag to crag, with hollow knoll
Echoes the thunder. Hark 1 to ocean's roll,—
Midst terror terrible Ξ the heaving main
Foams on in darkness, nor can find a goal.
Rocks echo dread to rocks that peal again,

And all save he alone bend to Destruction’s reign.

Louder and clearer grows the tempest’s peal,
Τὴε vollied thunder rolls amain, the flash
⁷ Of wreathed lightning plays, but to reveal‚
*O Heavenl that godlike form. The last dread
crash
Hath hurl’d him headlong: how the flint rocks
gash
His tortured limbs 5 but now a crag has caught
In rough embrace his form 1 though wildly gnash
His frenzied teeth, the secret's still untaught 3
He hurls to Heaven his curse, unmoved, unawed
by aught.

“Tyrant of Heaven, thrice cursed be she who
bore thee,

And cursed be all who own thy despot sway 3
Cowards and slaves may basely still adore thee,
That will I never: let thy lightnings play,
