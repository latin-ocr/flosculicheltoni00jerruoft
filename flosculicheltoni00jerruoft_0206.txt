178 MORTE D'ARTHUR.

And barren chasms, and all to right and left

The bare black cliff clang’d round him, as he based
His feet on juts of slippery crag, that rang

Sharp smitten with the dint of armed heels—

And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,

And the long glories of the winter moon.

. Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to sternf·
Beneath them 3 and descending they were ware
That all the decks were dense with stately forms
Bleck-stoled, blaek-hooded‚ like a dream—by these

, Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from

them rose

A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,

And, as it were one voice, an agony

Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills

All night in a waste land, where no one comes,

Or hath come, since the making of the world.

Then murmur'd Arthur‚ ‘⁴ Plaee me in the barge.’'

And to the barge they came. Then those three
Queens

Put forth their hands, and ⁴took the King, and* wept.
