THE PRINCESS.

Now sleeps the c'rimson¹ petal‚ v>now-the white,>
Nor waves the Cypress in the palace walk( , -

. Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font‚' ;‘ Δ
The fire-fly wakensv: waken* thou with me. ’ ’

Now droOps the 'milk-white peacock like'a‘ ghost‚
And like 3 ghost she glimmers on to me.

Now lies the earth all Danae to the stam,
And 311 thy heart lies open unto me.

Now slides 'the silent meteor on, and leaves ν
Α shining furrow as thy thoughts in me, , , ι ’ῑ

Now folds the lily-all her sweetness up,
And slips into the bosom of the lake :
So fold thyself‚ my dearest thou, and slip
Into my bosom, and be lost in me.

Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height ι
W hat pleasure dwells in height (the shepherd sang),
