3 20 LAODAMIA.

Of all that is most beauteouS, imaged here
In happier beauty3 more pellucid streams,
An ampler ether, a diviner air,
And fields invested with purpureal gleams 3
Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest
day
Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey.

Yet there the soul shall enter, which hath earn’d
That privilege by virtue—Ill, said he,
The end of man's existence I discern’d,
Who from ignoble games and revelry
Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight‚
While tears were thy best pastime—day and
night 3

And while my youthful peers before my eyes,
Each hero following his‘ peculiar bent,
Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise
By martial sports,-—or, seated in the tent,
Chieftains and kings in council were detain'd,
What time the fleet at Aulis lay enchain’d.

The wish'd-for wind was given :-1 then revolved
The oracle, upon the silent sea 3
And if no worthier led the way, resolved
That of a thousand vessels mine should be
The foremost prow in pressing to the.strand,—
Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand.
