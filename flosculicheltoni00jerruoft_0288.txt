260 msnop HATTO.

‘⁴ I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,'’ replied he,
“ 'Tis the safest place in Germany 3

The walls are high, and the shores are steep‚
And the stream is strong, and the water deep.’'

Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,

And he cross’d the Rhine without delay,
And reach'd his tower, and barr’d with care
All the windows, doors, and loopholes there.

He laid him down and closed his eyes 3

But soon a scream made him arise.

He started, and saw two eyes of flame

On his pillow from whence the screaming came.

He listen'd and look'd--it was only the cat,
But the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,
For she sat screaming mad with sear

At the army of rats that were drawing near.

For they have swam over the river so deep,
And they have climb'd the shores so steep‚
And up to the tower their way is bent,

To do the work for which they were sent.

They are not to be told by the dozen or score,
By thousands they come, and by myriads and more ;
Such numbers had never been heard of before,
Such a judgment had never been witness’d of yore.
