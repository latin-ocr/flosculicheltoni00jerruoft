356 ATALANTA IN CALYDON.

For of the one comes poison, and a curse

Falls from the other, and burns the lives of men.
But thou, son, be not fill'd with evil dreams‚

Nor with desire of these things ; for with time
Blind love burns out 3 but if one seed it full¹

Till some discolouring stain dyes all his life,

He shall keep nothing praiseworthy‚ nor die

The sweet wise death of old men honourable‚

Who have lived out all the length of all their years
Blameless‚ and seen well—pleased the face of gods,
And without shame and fear have wrought

Things memorable3 and while their days held out,
In sight of all men and the sun’s great light

Have gat them glory‚ and given of their own praise
To the earth that bare them and the day that bred‚ t.
Home-friends and far-off hospitalitieS‚

And fill’d with gracious and memorial fame

Lands loved of summer or wash'd by violent seas,
Towns populous and many unfooted wayS,

And alien lips and native with their own.

But when white age and venerable death

Mow down their strength and life within their limbs‚
Drain out the blood and darken their clear eyeS‚
Immortal honour is on them, having pass'd

T hrough splendid life and death desirable

To the clear seat and remote throne of souls,
Lands undiscoverable in the unheard-of west,
Round which the strong stream of a sacred sea
Rolls without wind for ever, and the snow

There shows not her white wings and windy feet,
