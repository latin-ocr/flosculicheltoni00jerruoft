140 ’ KING RICHARD 11.

For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal‚ or usurp.

And though you think, that all, as you have done,
Have torn their souls‚ by turning them from us,
And we are barren, and bereft of friends 3—-
Yet know‚-my master, God omnipotent,

Is mustering in his clouds, on our behalf,
Armies of pestilence 3 and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn, and unbegot,

That list your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke‚ (for yond, methinks, he is‚)
That every stride he makes upon my land,

Is dangerous treason ε 116 is come to ope

The purple testament of bleeding war 3

But ere the crown he look for live in peace,
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become the flower of England's face 3
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation‚ and bedew

Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

NORTH. The King of heaven forbid, our lord
the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush’d upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,
