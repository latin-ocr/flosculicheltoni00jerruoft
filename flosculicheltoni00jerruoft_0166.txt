KING RICHARD II

Ac'r 3, Se. 3.

DUKE OF YORK. KING RICHARD. , EARL OF
NORTHUMBERLAND.

YORK. See, see, King Riehard doth himself ap-
pear,

As doth the blushing discontented sun,
From out the fiery portal of the east 3
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory, and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident.
Yet looks he like a king 3 behold his eye,
As bright as is the eagIe's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a show.

K. RICH. We are amazed 3 and thus long have
we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence?
If we be not, show us the hand of God
That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship
