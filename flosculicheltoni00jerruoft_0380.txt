3 52 THE PR1NCEss,

In height and cold, the splendour of the hius?
But cease to move so near the heavens, and cease
To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,

To sit a star upon the sparkling spire3

And come, for Love is of the valley, come,
For Love is of the vassey, come thou down
And find him 3 by the valley threshold‚ he,

Or hand in hand with plenty of the maize‚

Or red with spurted purple of the vats‚

Or foxlike in the vine 3 nor cares to walk
With Death and Morning on the Silver Horns,
Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,
Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,
That huddling slant in eloven furrow falls

To roll the torrent out of dusky doors :

But follow : let the torrent dance thee down
To find him in the valley 3 let the wild
Lean—headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave

The monstrous ledges there to slope and spill
Their thousand wreaths of dangling water smoke,
That. like a broken purpose waste in air.

So waste not thou : but come, for all the vales
Await thee 3 azure pillars of the heath

Arise to thee3 the children call, and I

Thy shepherd pipe‚ and sweet is every sound‚
Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet ; .
Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
The moan of doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumerable bees.

TENstoN.
