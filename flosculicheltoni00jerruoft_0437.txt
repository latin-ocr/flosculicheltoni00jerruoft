THE DEATH OF SOCRATES. 409

Who pass’d in blood without applause or crown,

From that loud day to where we cannot see :
‚ Such loss their gain, and such defeat renown,
Such death their victory.

Likewise even now did his own peace rebuke
In prison his moved friends for fruitless fears 3
Then spake the sage, when that accustom'd look
Had set a truce to tears :—

“ Upon their death the silver swans rejoice‚
Meeting that God to whom their lives belong,
And pour the glory of their treasured voice
In floods of jubilant song :

“ Shall I not too be glad, who pass to range
In some best place with the great dead, my peerS,
Proceeding through all form of nobler change
Down unimagined years?

“ For I believe I am not wholly dust,

But somewhere, somewhere, with diviner powers,
They greatly live, the spirits of the just,

A larger life than ours.

‘⁴ For we abiding in infirmity,

In fleshly tabernacles groan forlorn,
Expecting, till on this mortality

It break, the perfect morn.
