292 FAERIE QUEEN.

So long as breath and hable puissaunce
Did native corage unto him supply,
His pace he freshly forward did advaunce,
And carried her beyond all ieopardy.
But nought that wanteth rest can long aby 3
He, having through incessant traveill spent
His force, at last perforce adowne did ly,
Ne foot could further move : the lady gent
Thereat was suddein strook with great astonish-
ment 3

And, forst t' alight‚ on foot mote algates fare
A traveiler unwonted to such way 3- >

N eed teacheth her this lesson, hard and rare,
That fortune all in equall launce doth sway,
And mortall miseries doth makeher play. ’

So long she traveild‚ till at length she came
To an hilles side, which did to her bewray

A little valley subject to the same,

All cover'd with thick woodes that quite it overcame.

Through th’ tops of the high trees she did descry
A little smoke, whose vapour‚ thin and light,
Reeking alost, uprolled to the sky:
Which cheerefull signe did send unto her sight
That in the same did wonne some living white. Δ
Eftsoones her steps she thereunto applyd, , ,ψ
And came at last, in weary wretched plight‚
Unto the place to which her hope did guyde,
To find some refuge there, and rest her wearie syde.
