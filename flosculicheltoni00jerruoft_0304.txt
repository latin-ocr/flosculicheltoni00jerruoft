KING JOHN

ACT 2, SC. 1.
CHATlLLON. KING PHILIP. KING JOHN.

CHAT. T hen turn your forces from this paltry
siege,

And stir them up against a mightier task.
England, impatient of your just demands,
Hath put himself in arms 3 the adverse winds,
Whose leisure Ι have stay'd, have given him time
To land his legions all as soon as Ι.
His marches are expedient to this town 3
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
With him along is come the mother-queen,
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife3
With her, her niece, the Lady Blanche of Spain 3
With them a bastard of the king deceased ;
And all the unsettled humours of the land,—
