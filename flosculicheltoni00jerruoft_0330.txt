302 THOMAS THE RHYMER.

With gentle hand and soothing tongue‚
She bore the leech's part 3

And while she o’er his sick-bed hung,
He paid her with his heart.

O fatal was the gift, I ween!
For, doom’d in evil tide,

The maid must be rude Cornwall's queen,
His cowardly uncle’s bride.

Their loveS, their woeS, the gifted bard
In fairy tissue wove 3

Where lords, and knights, and ladies bright‚
In gay confusion strove.

The Garde Joyeuse, amid the tale,
High rear'd its glittering head 3 ’
And Avalon's enchanted vale
In all its wonders spread.

Brangwain was there, and Segramore‚
And flend-born Merlin's gramarye ς

Of that famed wizard's mighty lore,
Ο who could sing but he?

Through many a maze the winning song
In changeful passion led,

Till bent at length the listening throng
O'er Tristrem's dying bed.
