BEDD-GELERT.

“ Hell-hound ! by thee my child's devour’d !’'
The frantie father cried—

T hen to the hilt his vengeful sword
He plunged in Gelert’s side.

His suppliant‚ as to earth he fell,
No pity could impart‚

And still his Gelert’s dying yell
Pass'd heavy o’er his heart.

Aroused by Gelert's dying yeH,
Some slumberer waken’d nigh :
What words the parent’s joy can tell,

To hear his infant cry?

Conceal'd beneath a mangled heap
His hurried search had miss'd,

All glowing from his rosy sleep
His cherub boy he kiss’d.

Nor scratch had he, nor harm, nor dread——
But the same couch beneath

Lay a great wolf all torn and dead,
T remendous still in death.

Ah, what was then Llewelyn’s pain ἔ
For now the truth was clear :

The gallant hound the wolf had slain
To save Llewelyn’s heir.
