THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

’ Other footsteps Labour leaveth,
And the soil where she hath trod,
(As the step of fairy weaveth
Brighter verdure in the sod‚)
Many a fane and palace raiseth—
While in shadowy array,
Many a “ column'd vista'’ traceth
Lines of dimness far away:
There the high Cathedral springeth‚
There the dim Cathedral-aisle,
With the stately chancel, ringeth
To the organ's note the while :
There through mountain and o’er valley
Darts the lightning-caravan,
Bearirig to each crowded alley
News of peace with fellow-man ε
There the steam-ship swiftly dashes‚
There the wonder-working wire
On its lightning-pinion flashes
Swiftly- sostly, words of fire :
There the earth to man is yielding‚
And, where sand with sand had met,
Gleams a “ wilderness of building‚‘'
Tower and spire and minaret.

Such the footsteps Labour traceth—
Poets, ye have sung too long
How the scourge of war effaceth

T racks of Labour—change your song ἵ
