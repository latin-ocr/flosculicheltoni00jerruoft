36 KING JOHN.

Or madly think, a babe of clouts were he ε
Ι am not mad 3 too well, too well Ι feel

The different plagues of each calamity.

K. PHI. Bind up your hairs.

CONST. Yes, that I will 3 and wherefore will I
do it?
Ι tore them from their bonds 3 and cried aloud‚
·'‘ O that these hands could so redeem rny son
As they have given these hairs their liberty ¹''
But now Ι envy at their liberty,
And will again commit them to their bonds,
Because my poor child is a prisoner. —
And, father C·ardinal‚ Ι have heard you say,
T hat we shall see and know our friends in heaven :
If that be true, Ι shall see my boy again 3
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire, ⁴
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker sorr0w eat this bud‚
And chase the native beauty from his eheek,
And he will look as hollow as a ghost3
As dim and meagre as an ague' s fit3
And so he'll die 3 and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven, ’ ,.
