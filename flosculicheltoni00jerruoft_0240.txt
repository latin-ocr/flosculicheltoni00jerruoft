212 HERMANN AND DOROTHEA.

But yet, alas, how near is the foe! The waves of
the Rhine-stream

Guard us still, it is true 3 but what are rivers or
mountains

In the way of that terrible people that comes like a
tempest3

They who gather together the young from every
quarter,

And the old with the young, and fierce press on 3

, and the strong host

F ears not the face of death, and anny crowds upon ·
army. ‘

And amid times like these ean a German rest in his
homestead?

Hope perhaps to shun the struggle that menaces all
men? ·

Nay, dear mother, from this day forth unwelcome to
me ’tis,

That I excused have just now been, when out of
our townsmen

Those who should war were chosen by lot. '’Tis
true I alone arn ’

Now as your son, and large is our hostel, and

¹ weighty the home-work 3

But were it not a far worthier course to combat
beforehand

At the frontier's line, than here wait slavery’s
coming?

Yea, my spirit replies that it is 3 in the depth of my
bosom
