214 HERMANN AND DOROTHEAL

Springs up courage and strong desire, in the cause
of my country

Active to live and to die, and to give an example to
others. '

Oh, were but the strength of the German youth at
the frontier

Gather’d and banded 1n firm resolve not to yield to
the stranger‚

N e’er would they with destructive feet on the
beauteous' soil tread,

And consume in the sight of our eyes the fruit of the
dear land,

And make slaves of the men, and prey of the wives
and the maidens.

Mother, true I tell you, deep in my heart the
resolve is

Quickly and surely to do what seems mostfitting
and worthy,

For who ponders long, he takes not always the best
course.

Mother, I turn not back to the house. From hence⁴
I go onwards

Straightway into the town, and offer at once to the
war-host

This my arm and my beart, to work my Fatherland's
service.''

GOETHE
(translated by Dr. leewell).
