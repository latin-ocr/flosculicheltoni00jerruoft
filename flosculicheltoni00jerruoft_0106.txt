THE FATAL SISTERS.

Low the dauntless Earl is laid,

Gored with many a gaping wound 3
Fate demands a nobler head 3

Soon a King shall bite the ground.

Long his loss shall Eirin weep 3
Ne'er again his likeness see :

Long her strains in sorrow steep—
Strains of immortality!

'Horror covers all the heath 3
Clouds of carnage blot the sun z

SisterS, weave the web of death—
Sisters‚ cease3 the work is done.

Hail the task, and hail the hands 1
Songs of joy and triumph sing!

Joy to the victorious bands 3
Triumph to the younger King.

Mortal‚ thou that hear’st the tale,
Learn the tenor of our song :

Seotland through each winding vale,
Far and wide the notes prolong.

Sisters‚ hence with spurs of speed,
Each her thundering falchion wield 3
Each bestride her sable steed:
Hurry, hurry to the field„

GRAv.
