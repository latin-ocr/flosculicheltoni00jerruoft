TROILUS AND CRESSIDA

-AcT 1, Se. 3.

AGAMEMNON, NESTOR. ULYSSES.

AG. Princes,

What grief hath set this jaundice on your cheeks?

The ample proposition, that hope makes

In all designs begun on earth below,

Fails in the promised largeness 3 cheeks and disas—
'ters

Grow in the veins of actions highest rear’d ;

As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,

'Infect the sound pine, and divert his grain,

Tortive and errant from his course of growth.

Nor, princes, is it matter new to us, ¹

That we com-e short of our suppose so far,

That‚ after seven years’ siege, yet Troy walls stand 3

Sith every action that hath gone before,

Whereof we have record, trial did draw

Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,

And that unbodied figure of the thought

That gav't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,

Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works 3

And think them shames, which are, indeed, nought
else
