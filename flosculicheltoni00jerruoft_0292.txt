LORD OF THE ISLES

CANTo III.

NIGH came the strangers, and more nigh 5—
Still less they pleased the Monarch’s eye.
Men were they all of evil mien‚
Down-look'd‚ unwilling to be seen j

They moved with half-resolved pace,

And bent on earth each gloomy face.

The foremost two were fair array’d

With brogue and bonnet, trews and plaid, =
And bore the arms of mountaineers‚
Daggers and broadswords, bows and spears.
The three that lagg'd small space behind,
Seem'd serfs of more degraded kind ; ἢ
Goat-skins or deer-hides o'er thern cast,
Made a rude fence against the blast 3

Their arms and feet and heads were bare,
Matted their beards, unshorn their hair;
For arms, the caitiffs bore in hand

A club, an axe, a rusty brand.
