1 3 0 BEDD-GELERT.

Vain, vain was all Llewelyn’s woe—
“ Best of thy kind, adieu 1

The frantie deed which laid thee low
This heart shall ever rue !”

And now a gallant tomb they mise,
With costly sculpture deck'd‚

And meumes, storied with his praise‚
Poor Gelert’s bones protect.

Here never could the spearman pass
Or forester unmoved:

Here oft the tear-besprinkled grass
Llewelyn’s sorrow proved.

And here he hung his horn and spear 3
And oft as evening fell,

In fancy's ‚piercing sounds would hear
Poor Gelert's dying yell.

SPENCER.
