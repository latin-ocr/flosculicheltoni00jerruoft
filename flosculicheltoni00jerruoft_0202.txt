174 , GONDOLINE.

And suddenly they join'd their hands,
And utter'd a joyous cry,

And round about the cauldron stout
They danced right merrily.

And now they stopp’d 3 and each prepared
To tell what she had done

Since last the lady of the night
Her waning course had run.

Behind a rock stood Gondoline‚
Thiek weeds her face did veil‚

And she lean'd fearful forwarder
To hear the dreadful tale.

KIRKE WHITE.
