COLIN'S COMPLAINT.

DESPAIRING beside a clear stream,
A shepherd forsaken was laid,
And, while a false nymph was his theme,
, Α willow supported his head.
The wind that blew over the plain,
To his sighs with a sigh did reply ;
And the brook, in return to his pain,
Ran mournfully murmuring by.

Alas! silly swain that Ι was 1
(ssus sadly complaining he cried 3)
When first Ι beheld that fair face,
'Twere better by far I had died.
She talk'd‚ and I bless’d her dear tongue;
When she smiled‚ it was pleasure too great 3
Ι listen'd and cried when she sung,
Was nightingale ever so sweet!

How foolish was I to believe
She could dote on so lowly a clown,
Or that her fond heart would not grieve
To forsake the fine folk of the town 1
