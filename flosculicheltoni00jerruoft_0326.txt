γ THOMAS THE RHYMER.

THE feast was spread in Erchildoune,
In Learmont’s high and ancient hall 3

And there were knights of great renown,
And ladies laced in pall.

Nor lack'd they, while they sat at dine,
The music nor the tale,

Nor goblets of the blood-red wine,
Nor mantling quaighs of ale.

True Thomas rose, with harp in hand,
When as the feast was done

(In minstrel strife‚ in F airy Land,
The elfin harp he won).

Hush'd were the throng‚ both limb and tongue‚
And harpers for envy pale 3 ⁸
And armed lords lean'd on their swords,
And listen'd to the tale.
