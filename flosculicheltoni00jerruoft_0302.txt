2 74 ARIADNE.

That sight of home and thy grey father’s face
Were less a joy to thee, and lightlier held?

Thy sail Ξ thy sail 1 O do my watery eyes

Take part with thee so loved to crush me down?
Gone Ι gone l and wilt thou, wilt thou not return Ρ
Hearssess, unfearing the just Gods, wilt thou,
Theseus, my lord, my love, desert me thus ?—
Thus leave me stranger in this strange wild land
Friendless‚ afar from all Ι left for thee,—

Crete‚ my old home, and my ancestral halls‚

My father's love, and the remember'd haunts

Of ehildhood-—all that knew me, all I knew?

All, all: woe! woe! that I shall know no more.
Why didst thou lure me, craftiest, from my home?
There if, thy love grown cold, thou thus had fled,
I had found comfort in fond words and smiles

F amiliar, and the pity of my kin 3

Tears wept with mine—tears wept by loving eyes,
That had wash'd out thy traces from my beart,
Perchance in years had given me back to J'oy.

ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ.
