PARADISE LOST

BOOK VI.

Sosaying, a noble stroke he lifted high,

Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell

On the proud erest of Satan, that no sight,

’ Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield

Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge

He back recoil'd3 the tenth on bended knee

His massy spear upstaid 3 as if on earth

Winds underground, or waters forcing way,

Sidelong had push’d a mountain from his seat,

Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seized

The rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see

Thus foil'd their mightiest 3 ours joy fill'd‚ and shout‚

Presage of victory, and fierce desire

Of battle ε Whereat Michael bid sound

The Archangel trumpet 3 through the vast of
Heaven

It sounded, and· the faithful annies rung

Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze

The adverse legions, nor less hideous join’d .
The horrid shock.
