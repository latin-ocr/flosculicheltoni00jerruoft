different class of minds and of conditions 3 but by< .
their requirements for Entrance Examinations, and
for open Scholarships. I do not at all desire to ·
see Verse Composition a sine qua non, or to limit
even these Examinations to linguistic excellence.
Stil] more should ”I lament the failure of the attempts
now being made at Cambridge to extend the scope
of the Classical T ripos Examination, so as to test
power of thought as well as power of expression.
But till it has been proved more distinctly, that the
study of language is not the best training for the
young mind 3 that in this study Composition is
not of primary importance 3 and that Prose Com-
position, either in our own language or in Latin and
Greek, can be perfectly sufficient without theaid
of Verse,—I trust that room may still be found
for the kind of Composstion, which is represented
in these pages. I am inclined to think that
Dr. Arnold’s conclusion from experience on the
'subject is a true one, and that what seems to 5
many, as it once did to him, a “ contemptible pret-
tiness of the understanding,'’ may be found to have

a real intellectual and educational value.
