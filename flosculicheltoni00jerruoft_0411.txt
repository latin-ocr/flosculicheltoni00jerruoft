CARTHAGE. 383

ι Thine own loved city *, Beauty's nursling‚ rise

'Neath the bright heaven that smiled in Dido's
eyes -

Ah Ξ lovelorn Dido, like the widow'd dove,

Self-doom'd to die †—and know no second love—

To mark her stretch the iv'ry sceptre o'er

N umidia’s wastes, Hispania’s golden shore 3

Grasp the twin portals of the western main,

And reap the fruitage of th' Hesperian plain ;

Wed the fresh sweets of Grecia’s humbler flowers

To the proud scent of Yemen's spicy bowers 5

And teach rude Europe’s homely dames to glow

In Tyrian robes of hyacinthine How.—

’Twas Carthage held the gorgeous East in see,

And Carthage sway'd the chiefdom of the sea z

For her the Orient shed, like snow-flakes, down ⁸

The fleecy‡ tribute from her forests strown 3

The fairy spinster of Kathay ξ still drew

Its silken gossamer of golden hue ;

Cashmerian skies rain'd rose of loveliest bloom,

That breathed alost the Atar-Gul's perfume 5

* From Augustin we leam that Carthage was one of the
favourite haunts of Venus.

† The writer has followed the story of Dido as related
by Justin, in preference to Virgil's ingenious fiction: the
former says that Iarbas, King of Getulia, having sought her
hand, she, to avoid a detested alliance, ascending a funeral
pile, with her own hand effectually forbad the banns.
