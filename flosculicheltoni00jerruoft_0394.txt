366 GREECE.

Travelling in glory through the vaulted sky
The sun was but the car of Deity3

While the lone wanderer blest the virgin queen,
Whose radiance slept upon the nightly scene.
Conscious that all was majesty’s abode

· Nature they deified instead of God.

Such, clime of glory, was thy pristine state
Far as reverted thought ean penetrate 3
Such were the simple joys thy sons possest
Endow'd with freedom and with plenty blest-
Too soon, alas Ξ wide o'er that smiling land
The demon war outstretch’d his blood-stain'd hand 3
Too soon, ambitious of a foreign sway‚
Impetuous Hellas sought the battle fray.
Now sternly gathering for the distant fight
The Grecian chiefs their martial hosts unite3
With foam-wreath'd prows th' AEgean main explere,
And land adventurous on the Trojan shore.
High was the fame and matchless the renown
Those chieftains won before the Phrygian town.
Applauding ages still their deeds rehearse,
Shrined by Maeonia's bard in deathless verse.
T en years revolving saw that host outspread
Beneath the walls where warriors fought and bled 5
Ten years o'er Troy pursued their slow career,
And freedorn’s banner still was waving there.
But vain each effort‚ vain each valiant deed,
Proud city, to annul what Heaven decreed.
The deadly lance, the victor’s ruthless sword
Avenged at length the wrongs of Sparta's lord3
