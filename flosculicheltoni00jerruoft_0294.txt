266 LoRD oF THE ISLES.

Onward, still mute, they kept the nack,—
“Tell who ye be, or else stand back‚''

Said Bruce, “in deserts where they meet,
Men pass not as in peaceful street.''

still, at his stem command, they stood,
And proffer’d greeting brief and rude 3

But acted courtesy so ill

As seem’d of sear, and not of will.

‘⁴ Wanderers are we, as you may be ;
.Men hither driven by wind and sea,

Who, if you list to taste our cheer‚ ·

W ill share with you this fallow deer.'’—

“ If from the sea, where lies your bark ?”

‘⁶ Ten fathom deep in ocean dark !

W reek'd yesternight—but we are men,

Who little sense of peril ken.

The shades come down, the day is shut,

W ill you go with us to the hut?”

‘⁶ Our vessel waits us in the bay 3

Thanks for your proffer—have good day.'’—
“ Was that your galley then, that rode

Not far from shore when evening glow’d ?''-—
“ It was.'’—“ Then spare your needless pain,
There will she now be sought in vain.
