398 THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

Vanish'd that resplendent vision,
But the tones that o'er me stole,
Like a voice from vales Elysian‚
Still re-echo to my soul 3
And that peaceful proclamation,
Like the fiery cross of War,
Echoed on through many a nation,
Roused mankind anear—afar:
And they built a temple gleaming
Brilliant as Aladdin’s hall,
Where the sunlight inward streaming
Pierced through each crystal wall 3
W here the light in rainbow gushes
Revels down the sun-lit nave,
And below the great world rushes,
And above the banners wave ;
And from many a golden river,
And from many a fruitful vale,
Many a city, where for ever
Whitens far the ocean-sail‚
Brought they choicest, best oblations‚
Gems of price from far Peru, ’
And around were met the nations
Swarthy Turk and slim Hindoo ε
Proudly flashes column, proudly
Over head the banners float,
While each stately vista loudly
'Echoes far the organ-note :
And the kindreds of the nations
In one vast, consentient throng,
