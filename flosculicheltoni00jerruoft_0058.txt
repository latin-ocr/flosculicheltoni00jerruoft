‚30 TEARS OF SCOTLAND.

Thy towering spirit now is broke,
Thy neck is bended to the yoke ;
What foreign arms could never quell,
By civil rage and rancour fell.

The rural pipe and merry lay

No more shall cheer the happy day z

No social soenes of gay delight

Beguile the dreary winter night :

No sti-ains but those of sorrow flow,
And nought be heard but sounds of woe,
While the pale phantoms of the slain
'Glide nightly o’er the silent plain.

O baneful cause, O fatal morn,

’ Accursed to ages yet unborn 1

The sons against their fathers stood 3
The parents shed their children's blood.
Yet, when the rage of battle ceased,
The victor's soul was not appeased 3
The naked and forlorn must feel
Devouring flames and murd'ring steel Ξ

The pious mother, doom'd to death,
Forsaken, wanders o’er the heath ;.

The bleak winds whistle round her head 3
Her helpless orphans cry for bread l

Bereft of shelter, food, and friend,

She views the shades of night descend,
And, stretch’d beneath the inclement skies,
Weeps o’er her tender babes—and dies 1
