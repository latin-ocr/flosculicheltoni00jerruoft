THE DEATH OF SOCRATES.

THE day was come ε its earliest morn had brought
His true disciples to the teacher's cell,

who, gathering round the master of their thought,
Wept him they loved so well.

Yea, moving blindly in much heaviness,
And left amid perplexities alone,

They mourn’d as men, in a great wssderness,
Mourn when their guide is gone.

Remembering how, without reward or praise,
That temperate truth had drawn the hope of
Greece‚
Leading to wisdorn,—pleasant are her ways,
And all her paths are peace :

But sternly sent the arrogant to school,

And on false-seeming set the brand of shame 5
Looking beyond the pomp of petty rule,

To whence true honour came.
