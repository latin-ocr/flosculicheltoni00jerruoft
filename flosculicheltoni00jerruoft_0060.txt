32 TEARS OF SCOTLAND.

Whilst the warm blood bedews my veins‚
And unimpair'd remembrance reigns,
Resentment of my country's fate

Within my filial heart shall beat ;

And spite of her insulting foe,

My sympathizing verse shall flow 3-—

“ Momn, hapless Caledonia, mourn

Thy banish’d peace, thy laurels torn !’'

SMOLLETT.
