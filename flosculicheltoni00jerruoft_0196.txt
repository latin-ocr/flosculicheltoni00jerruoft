GONDOLINE.

SHE wander’d o'er the lonely shore,
The curlew scream’d above 3

She heard the scream with a sickening heart,
Much boding of her love.

But still she kept her Ionely way,
And this was all her cry,

Oh 1 tell me but if Bertrand live,
And I in peace shall die.

And now she came to a horrible fist,
All in the rock's hard side,

A bleak and blasted oak o'erspread
The cavern yawning wide.

And pendent from its dismal top
The deadly nightshade hung;

The hemlock and the aconite
Across the mouth were flung.
