The last humble boon that Ι crave,

Is to shade me with cypress and yew 3 -
And when she looks down in my grave,

Let her own that her shepherd was true.

Then to her new love let her go,
And deck her in golden array 3
Be finest at every fine show,
And frolic it all the long day:
While Colin, forgotten and gone,
No more shall be talk'd of or seen,
Unless when beneath the pale moon
’ His ghost shall glide over the green.

RowE.
