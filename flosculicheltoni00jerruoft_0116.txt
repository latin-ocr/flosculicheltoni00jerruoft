88 THE LOTUs EATERS.

Far below them in the valleys‚ and the clouds are
lightly curl'd

Round their golden houses, girdled with the
gleaming world ;

Where they smile in secret looking over wasted
lands,

Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring
deeps and fiery sands‚

Clauging fights and flaming towns, and sinking
ships, and praying hands.

But' they smile3 they find a music centred in a
doleful song,

Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of

wrong,

Like a tale of little meaning though the words are
strong ;

Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave
the soil,

Sow the seed and reap the harvest with enduring

toil,

Storing yearly little dues of wheat and wine and oil:

Till they perish and they suffen—seme, 'tis whis-
per'd—down in hell

Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys
dwell,

Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.

TENNYSON.
