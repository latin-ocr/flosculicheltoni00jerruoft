240 ROM EO AND JULIET.

In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift 3

And hither shall he corne, and he and I

Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua:

And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish sear

Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JUL. Give me, oh give me ἔ tell me not of sear.

F RIAR. Hold, get you gone, be strong and
prosperous
In this resolve 3 I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JUL. Love, give me strength! and strength shall
help afford 3

F arewell‚ dear father.

SHAKSPERE.
