272 ARIADNE.

O fearful stillness! O that one would speak!

O would that I were fronting wolf or pard

But by thy side this moment3 so strange sear

Possesses me, O love, apart from thee.

The galley! gone. Ye Gods 1 it is not gone:

Here by this rock it lay but yesternight.

Gone! through this track its keel slid down the
shore 3

And I slept calmly as it cleft the sea.

- Gone, gone! where gone? That sail! ’tis his—·

’tis his 1
Return, O Theseus! Theseus, love, return!
Thou wilt return? Thou dost but try my love?
Thou wilt return to make my foolish fears
Thy jest? Return l and 1 will laugh with thee!
Return‚ return 1 and canst thou hear my shrieks,
Nor heed my cry? and would’st thou have me
weep ?
Weep 1 I that wept white with wild sear the while
Thou slewest the abhorr'd monster. If it be
Thou takest pleasure in these bitter tears,
Come back and I will weep myself away—
A streaming Niobe—to win thy smiles 3
O stony heart! why wilt thou wring me thus?
Ο heart more cold unto my shrilling eries
Than these wild hills that wail to thee “ Return,'’
Than all these island rocks that shriek “ Return.''
Come back! Thou seest me rend this blinding
hair3
Hast thou not sworn each tress thou didst so prize
