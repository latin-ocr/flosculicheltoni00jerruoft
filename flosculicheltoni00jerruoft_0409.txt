CA RTHAGE.

Ἔσσεται ἦμαρ ὅταν ποτ’ ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἱρὴ,
καὶ Πρίαμος, καὶ λαὸς ἐϋμμελίω Πριάμοιο.-ΗΟΜΕΚ.

Tm( beauty gone, thy glory in the grave,

Mourn, widow'd daughter of the eastern wave Σ

Where now thy pennon flutt'ring to the breeze,

As some blithe gull that dances o'er the seas?

Where now the grove whose twilight bowers of green

Veil'd the dread charms of heaven’s immortal
queen '¹⁸‘ Ρ

Where the bright towers that girdled it below,

Like emerald gem, enshrined in virgin snow?

No more thy galleys speed them o’er the deep 3

No more on Cothon's † bay their shadows sleep 3

The leaf has wither'd from the sacred shade‚

The saintly holm, the laurel bower decay'd :

The vest of beauty now no more can vie

With the rich splendours of ethereal dye,

* Virg. AEn. i. 441 sqq.
† The harbour of Carthage 3 so called from an island of
that name at its mouth.
