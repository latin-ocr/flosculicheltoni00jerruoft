3 38 vmom MARTYR.

DOR. ’ ’ ’ ’ Thou sool!
That gloriest 1n having power to ravish
A trifle from me I am weary of3
What ιε this life to me? Not worth a thought,
Or if it be esteem'd‚ 'tis that I lose it*
To win a better· even thy malice serves,
To me, but as a ladder to mount up
To such a height of happiness, where Ι shall
Look down with scorn on thee, and on the world 3
Where, encircled with true pleasures, placed above
The reach of death, or time, ’twill be my glory ,
To think at what an easy price I bought it.
There's a perpetual spring, perpetual youth,
No joint-benumbing cold, or scorching heat3 ⁴
Famine nor age have any being there.
F orget for shame, your Tempe: bury 1n
Oblivion your feign' d Hesperian orchards3
The golden fruit, kept by the watchful dragon,
Which did require an Hercules to get it,
Compared with what grows in all plenty there,
Deserves not to be named. The Power I serve
Laughs at your happy Araby, and the
Elysian shades 3 for He hath made His bowers
Better indeed than you can fancy yours.

·MASSINGER.
