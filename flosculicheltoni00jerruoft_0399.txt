GREECE. 371

Your glory like a dream hath pass'd away 3
Your ruins lie, in sad yet stern decay ;
No mystic sounds Dodona's forest sweep,
And brooding stillness reigns on Delphi’s steep.
The spoiler Time hath travell’d through that land
With giant footstep and resistless hand.
Fabrics have totter'd at his stern behest‚
Fame's noblest monuments his might confest.
The citade‘l lies prostrate ’neath his tread‚
And the proud city silent as the dead.
Time’s iron grasp hath crumbled all to nought,
Crush’d all that Art had rear'd or Science wrought,
Erased each impress of that country’s name,
Nor spared a token of her ancient fame,
Save where some mossy pillar mouldering lies,
The lonely trophy of his victories.

Yet, Nature, thou amid the wrecks of Time
Art still as fair as in thine early prime.
The sweeping storm hath levell’d Grecia’s pride,
But thou, unhurt‚ its fury hast defied.
Time cannot shake Olympus' peak, that shrouds
Its awful grandeur in the circling clouds.
Still Sunium’s cliff, unscath'd by countless years,
Above the deep its craggy form uprears.
Its beauteous robe yet mantles Tempe's vale ;
Its waving woods yet whisper to the gale.
Still with rich flowers Hymettus' steep is crown'd,
And honied fragrance softly breathes around.
Oh ! while Art’s firmest structures 'are o’erthrown,
Their columns prostrate and their glory gone,
