358 ATALANTA IN CALYDON.

Nor thunder nor swift rain saith anything,

Nor the sun burns, but all things rest and thrive 3
And these, fill'd full of days, divine and dead, .
Sages and singers fiery from the god, >
And such as loved their land and all things good, Β
And, best beloved of best men, liberty:

Free lives and lips, free hands of men free-born,—
And whatsoever on earth was honourabIe,

And whosoever'of all the ephemeral seed,

Live there a life no liker to the godS,

But nearer than their life of terrene days.

Love thou such life, and look for such a death.

SWINBURNE. .
