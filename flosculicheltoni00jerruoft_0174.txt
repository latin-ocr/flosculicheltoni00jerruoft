As fast as the hail, as fast as the gale,
As fast as the mydnychte Ieme,

We borit the breiste of the burstyng swale
Or fluffit i' the flotyng faem.

And quhan to the Norroway shore we wan
We muntyd our steedis of the wynd,
And we splashit the floode, and we darnit the
woode,
And we left the shouir behinde.

F leet is the roe on the green Lomond,
And swift is the couryng grew ;
The rein-deir dun can eithly run,
Quhan the houndis and the hornis pursue.

But nowther the roe, nor the rein-deir dun
The hinde nor the couryng grew

Culde fly owr muntaine‚ muir, and dale,
As our braw steedis they flew.

The dales were deep, and the Doffrinis steep,
And we raise to the skies ee-bree 3

Quhite‚ quhite was our rode that was never trode
O’er the snawis of eternity.

And quhan we cam to the Lapland lone
The fairies war all in array,

For all the genii of the north
War keepyng their holiday.
