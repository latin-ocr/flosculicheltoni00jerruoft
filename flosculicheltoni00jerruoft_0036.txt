PARADISE LOST

Boox IV.

O THOU, that with surpassing glory crown'd‚

Look'st from thy sole dominion like the God

Of this new world 3 at whose sight all the stass

Hide their diminish’d heads 3 to thee Ι call,

But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,

O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams,

That bring to my remembrance from what state

I fell ; how glorious once above thy sphere 3

Till pride and worse ambition threw me down,

Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless
King ε

Ah wherefore! he deserved no such return

From me, whom he created what Ι was

In that bright eminence, and with his good

Upbraided none 3 nor was his service hard.

What could be less than to afford him praise,

The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks,

How due ! yet all his good proved ill in me,

And wrought but maliee3 lifted up so high

I 'sdain'd subjection, and thought one step higher
