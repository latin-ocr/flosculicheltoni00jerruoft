THE ANCIENT MARINER

CANTo Ι.

IT is an ancient Mariner‚
And he stoppeth one of three.

“By thy long grey beard, and glittering eye,
Now, wherefore stopp'st thou me?

‘⁶ The bridegroom’s doors are open’d wide,
And I am next of kin:

The guests are met, the feast is set ε
May’st hear the merry din.'’

He holds him with his skinny hand,
‘⁶ There was a ship‚’' quoth he.

“ Hold off 1 unhand me, grey-beard loon 1’'
Eftsoon his hand dropt he.

He holds him with his glittering eye——
The wedding-guest stood still,

And listens like a three—years’ child :
The mariner hath his will.
