HIAWATHA

CANTo V.

, ΟΝ the fourth day of his fasting κ ’

In his lodge he lay exhausted‚ Ἴ
From his cbuch ofleaves and branches
Gazing, with half-open eyelids‚

Full of shadowy dreams and visions,
On the dizzy swimming landscape,

On the gleaming of the water,

On the splendom of the sunset ς ’
And he saw a youth approaching,
Dress'd in garments green and yellow,
Coming through the purple twilight‚

T hrough the splendour of the sunset 3
Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead,
And his hair was soft and golden.
Standing at the open doorway,

Long he look’d at Hiawatha,

Look’d with pity and compassion

On his wasted form and features,

And, in accents like the sighing
