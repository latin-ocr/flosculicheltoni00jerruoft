COLtN's COMPLAINT.

To think that a beauty so gay,

So kind and so constant would prove 3
Or* go clad like our maidens in grey,

Or live in a cottage on love ἒ

What though Ι >have skill to complain‚
Though the Muses my temples have crown'd;
What though, when they hear my soft strain, ⁴

The virgins sit weeping around ;
Ah, Colin! thy hopes are in vain,
Thy pipe and thy Iaurel resign 3

'Thy fair one inclines to a swain

Whose music is sweeter than thine.

All you my companions so dear,
Who sorrow to see me betray’d,
Whatever Ι suffer, forbear,
F orbear to accuse the false maid.
Though through the wide world I should range,
’'ris in vain from my fortune to fly :
’T was hers to be false and to change 3
'T is mine to be constant and die.

If while my hard fate I sustain,
In her breast any pity is found,

Let her come with the nymphs of the plain,·
And see me laid low in the ground.
