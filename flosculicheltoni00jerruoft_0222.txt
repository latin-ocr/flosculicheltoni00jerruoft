 

194 ROMEO AND JULIET.

Back, foolish tearS, back to your native spring 3

Your tributary drops belong to woe,

Which yon, mistaking‚ offer up to Joy.

My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain 3

And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my
husband.

All this is comfort 3 wherefore weep I then?

Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,

That murder'd me. I would forget it fain 3

But, O l it presses to my memory,

Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.

SHAKSPERE,
