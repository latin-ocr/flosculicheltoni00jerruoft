192 ROMEO AND JULIET.

So fairly bound? Ο, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace Ξ

NURSE, There’s no trust,
No saith, no honesty in men 3 all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah ! where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae :—
These gfiefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo l

JUL. Blister’d be thy tongue,
For such a wish! he was not born to shame ε
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit 3
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
Sole monarch of the universal earth.

O, what a beast was I to chide at him 1

N URSE. Will you speak well of him that kill'd
your cousin ?

JUL. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah! poor my lord, what tongue shall smoothe thy
name,
When Ι, thy three-hours’ wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore‚ villain, didst thou kill my cousin ?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
