HYPERION

BOOK I.

MEANWHILE in other realms big tears were shed,
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,

, T oo huge for morta] tongue‚ or pen of scribe z .
The Titans fierce⁷ sels-hid, or prison-bound,
Groan’d for the old allegiance once more,

And listen²d in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.

But one of the whole mammoth brood still kept
His sovereignty, and rule, and majesty5

Stin sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up
From man to the sun's god, yet unsecure ε

For as among us mortals omens drear

Fright and perplex, so also shudder’d he

Not at dog’s howl‚ or gloom-bird’s hated screech‚
Or the familiar visiting of one

Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
