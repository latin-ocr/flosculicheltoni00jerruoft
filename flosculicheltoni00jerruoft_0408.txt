380 PROMETHEUS.

Hurl thy tremendous bolts—thou canst not slay!
Cursed be thy throne, and Cursed thy seat of bliss‚
And doubly cursed thyself. This fatal day

Has seal'd thy doom 3 now welcome dread abyss ἕ

Ye Winds, and Sun, and Earth‚ and Ooean, see y&
this ? '²

My harp hath ceased‚ but F ancy still would trace⁸

Each shadowy outline, ere its echoes die,

And lift the veil which heightens every grace,

And lends a sweeter charm to Poesy.

Forbear‚ fond Fancy ! nor to mortal eye

Reveal those visions not for mortal gaze 3

Still Isis’ charms in cherish’d mystery lie,

Nor would Ι that one thought of mine should raise
The veil unraised by man, the boast of ancient days,

Still may we view thee, Titan as thou art,

The type of constancy‚ and heavenly love 3

The bodied vision of some yearning heart

To mould Perfection's image, as it strove ’

To raise frail man to Heaven 3 thyself dost prove

A brave, unflinching champion to the end3

Thus Earth shall look for succour from above.

Vishnu '¹‘ hath shown that Heaven with Earth
may blend,

And Heaven still finds for Man a Saviour and a

Friend.

H. A. J., 1846.

* Vishnu, the principa] Idol of the Hindoos‚ said to have
been nine times incarnate.
