FAERIE QUEEN

BOOK III.

“ LIKE as an hynd forth singled from the heard,
That hath escaped from a ravenous beast‚

Yet flyes away, of her owne seete afeard,
And every leafe that shaketh with the least
Murmure of winde her terror hath encreast‚

So fledd fayre Florimell from her vaine feare,
Long after she from perill was releast:

Each shade she saw, and each noyse she did heare,

Did seeme to be the same which she escapt whileare.

All that same evening she in flying spent,
And all that night her course continewed 3
Nor did she let dull sleepe once to relent
Nor wearinesse to slack her hast, but fled
Ever alike, as if her former dred
Were hard behind, her ready to arrest:
And her white palfrey having conquered
The maistring raines out of her weary wrest‚ ‚
Perforce her carried where ever he thought best.
