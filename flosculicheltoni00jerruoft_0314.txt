286 DON RODERICK.

Made their ablutions in the mountain stream,
Obedient, then their faces to the earth
Bent in formality of easy prayer.

An arrow's flight above that mountain stream
There was a little glade, where, underneath
A long, smooth, mossy stone, a fountain rose.
An oak grew near, and with its ample boughs
O’ercanopied the spring: its fretted roots
Emboss'd the bank 3 and on their tufted bark
Grew plants which love the moisture and the

shade—

Short ferns, and longer leaves of wrinkled green,
Which bent toward the spring, and, when the wind
Made itself felt, just touch'd with gentle dip
The glassy surface, ruffled ne’er but then,
Save when some bubble, rising from the depth,
Burst, and with saintest circles mark’d its place,
Or if an insect skimm‘d it with his wing,
Or when in heavier drops the gather'd rain

« Fell from the oak's high bower. The mountain roe,

When, having drank there, he would bound across,
Drew up upon the bank his meeting feet,

And put forth half his force. With silent lapse ”
From thence through mossy banks the water stole 3
Then, murmuring, hasten'd to the glen below.
Diana might have loved in that sweet spot

To take her noontide rest 3 and, when she stoopt,
Hot from the chase, to drink, well pleased had seen
