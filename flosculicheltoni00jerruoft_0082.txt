54 TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.

But the protractive trials of great Jove,

To find persistive constancy in men?

The fineness of which metal is not found

In fortune’s love : for then, the bold and coward,
The wise and fooI, the artist and unread‚
The hard and soft, seem all affined and kin 3
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Distinction‚ with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away3

And what hath mass, or matter, by itself
Lies, rich in virtue and unmingled.

Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply

Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance

How many shallow bauble boats dare sail

Upon her patient breast, making their way

With those of nobler bulk?

But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage

The gentle Thetis, and, anon, behold

The strong-ribb'd bark through, liquid mountains
cut,

Bounding between the two moist elements‚

Like Perseus' horse : where's then the saucy boat,

Whose weak untimber’d sides but even now

Co—rivall'd greatness? either to harbour fled,
