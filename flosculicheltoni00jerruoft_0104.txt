THE FATAL SISTERS.

Mista‚ black, terrific maid,
Sangrida and Hilda see,

Join the wayward work to aid—
’Tis the woof of victory.

Ere the ruddy sun be set,
Pikes must shiver, javelins sing,
Blade with clattering buckler meet,
Hauberk crash and helmet ring.

(Weave the crimson web of war)
Let us go, and let us fiy,

Where our friends the conflict share—-
Where they triumph, where they die.

As the paths of fate we tread,

Wading through th’ ensanguined field,
Gondula and Geira spread

O'er the youthful King your shield.

We the reins to slaughter give—
Ours to kin, and ours to spare 3

Spite of danger, he shall live—
(Weave the crimson web of war.)

They whom once the desert-beach
Pent within its bleak domain,
Soon their ample sway shall stretch

O'er the plenty of the plain.
