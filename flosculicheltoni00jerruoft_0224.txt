LAMENT

FOR

JAMES, EARL OF'GLENCAIRN.

T HE wind blew hollow frae the hius,
By fits the sun’s departing bearn
Look'd on the fading yellow woods
That waved o’er Lugar's winding stream :
Beneath a craigy steep a Bard,
Laden with years and meikle pain,
In loud lament bewail'd his lord,
Whom death had all untimely ta'en.

He lean’d him to an ancient aik‚
Whose trunk was mouldering down with years5
His locks were bleached white wi’ time,
His hoary cheek was wet wi' tears Σ
And as he touch'd his trembling harp,
And as he tuned his doleful sang,
The winds lamenting thro’ their caves,
To echo bore the notes alang.
