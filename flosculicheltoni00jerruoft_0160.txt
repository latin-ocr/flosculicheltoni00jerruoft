HYPERION

BOOK 11.

O ΥΕ whom wrath consumes 1 who, passion stung,
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies !
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,

My voice is not a bellows unto ire.

Yet listen‚ ye who will, whilst Ι bring proof
How ye, perforee, must be content to stoop :
And in the proof much comfort will I give,
If ye will take that comfort in its truth.

We fall by course of nature’s law, not force
Of thunder‚ or of Jove. Great Saturn‚ thou
Hast sifted well the atom-universe 3

But for this reason that thou art the king
And only blind from sheer supremacy,

One avenue was shaded from thine eyes
Through which Ι wander’d to eternal truth.
And first as thou wast not the first of powers,
So art not thou the last: it cannot be—
Thou art not the beginning nor the end.
