THE SACK OF ROME ΒΥ ALARIC⁴

The ivory fretwork of the roof

Of carven cedar, and explore

The marvels of the enamell’d floor,
And couches soft of Tyrian woof.
Where languid forms at ease recline
With random limbs, and glitter by
On citron table cups of gold,
Crystal‚ and myrrhine, work divine,
Inwrought with fabled heroes old,

· Or richly boss’d in quaint design,

Thick-set with sparkling jewelry,

That flashes to the roof, where high
Aloft the marble columns twine

Their wreaths of ivy and cluster’d vine.
And all are hush'd and listening mute
To music of the warbling Inte,

And, breathing soft voluptuous fire,
The melting murmurs of the lyre‚

And sweetly plaintive Lydian flate,
Whose soul-dissolving tones conspire
From vocal stops and trembling stringS,
And swells the music fuller, higheir,
And falls, and swells again, and floats
In melting bliss of liquid notes
Through charmed air on tremulous wings,
Through shadowy moonlight colonnade‚
And far adown the umbrageous gloom,
The verdurous gloom of platane shade‚
To bowery depths and dark recesses

Of trailer-woven wildernesseS,
