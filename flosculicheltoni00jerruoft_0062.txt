KING JOHN

ACT 3, Sc, 4.

PANDULPH. CONSTANCE. KING PHILIP.

PAND. Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

CONST. Thou art not holy to belie me so ;
Ι arn not mad : this hair Ι tear is mine :
My name is Constance ,· Ι was Geoffrey’s wife 3
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.
Ι am not rnad 3--1 would to heaven Ι were ἔ
For then ’tis like I should forget myself :
O, if I could, what grief should Ι forget 1--
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canonized, Cardinal :
For, being not mad, but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver’d of these woes,
And teaehes me to kill or hang myself .-
If I were mad, Ι should forget my son3
