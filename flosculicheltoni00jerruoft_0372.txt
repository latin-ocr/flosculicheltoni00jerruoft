344 PARADISE REGAINED.

On a green bank, and set before him spread
A table of celestia] food, divine

Ambrosial fruits pluck’d from the tree of life,
And from the fount of life ambrosial drink.
That soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd
What hunger, if aught hunger, had impair’d,
Or thirst, and, as he fed, angelic quires

Sung heavenly anthems of his victory

Over Temptation and the Tempter proud.
