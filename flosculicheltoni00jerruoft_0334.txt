MACBETH

ACT 3, Sc. 4 >
MACBETH. ROSSE. LADY MACBETH.

MACB. Here had we now our country’s honour
roof’d‚
Were the graced person of our Banquo present ς
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance !

ROSSE. His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please it your
highness
To grace us with your royal company ?

MACB. The table’s full.
LEN. Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACB'. Where?

LEN. Here, my good lord. What is't that moves
your highness?
