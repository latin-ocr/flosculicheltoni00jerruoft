3 42 PARADISE REGAIN ED.

To whom thus Jesus : “Also it is written,
‘'l'empt not the Lord thy God,' ” he said and stood;
But Satan smitten with amazement fell.

As when Earth’s son Antaeus (to compare
Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove
With Jove’s Alcides, and oft foil’d still rose,
Receiving from his mother Earth new strength
Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple join’d,
Throttled at length in th' air, expired and fe113
So' after many a fall the tempter proud
Renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride ¹

Fell whence he stood tosee his victor fall.

And as that T heban monster thatproposed

Her riddle, and him who solVed it not, devour'd,
That once found out and solved, for grief and spite
Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep 3
So struck with dread and anguish fell the flend,-
And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought ’ “
(Joyless triumphals of his hoped success)

Ruin and desperation and dismay,

Who durst so proudly temptthe Son of God.

So Satan fell 3 and straight a fiery globe

Of angels on full sail of wing flew by,

Who on their plumy oars received him soft

From his uneasy station, and upbore

As on a floating couch through the blithe air,
There in a flowery valley set him down
