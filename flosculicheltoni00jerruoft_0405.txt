PROMETHEUS. 3 77

Alone ! but where is man? will he not turn,

And dare for thee what thou hast borne for him ?

He knows it not, nay more, has yet to leam

Thy love to him has been thine only crime ;

For this fell Vengeance claims her due, till Time

O’er all the world his reckless ocean sweeps z

Behold him captive where no step ean climb,

A lonesome watch o'er coming years he keeps,
Whilst Hope, his own fair child ²¹², turns from her

sire, and weeps.

Too noble soul, is such thy j0yless fate?

Exiled‚ and setter’d to this sea-girt steep‚

With nought to oppose but an immortal hate

To a stern tyrant's vengeance 3—round thee
sweep

Whirlwinds‚ and tempests, whilst the roaring deep

F oams on beneath thee in its wild career ;

And thou dost love them, though perchance may
creep .

A feeling o’er thee, yet apart from sear,

Which makes thee wish thy lot, and dwelling-place

less drear.

Yet shalt thou rise anon 3 thy day of woe‚

Though slowly, wanes: Fate murmurs “Thou
shalt rise

And see thy fallen once triumphant foe
No longer lord it o'er the prostrate skies;

’Ψ Thenas ἐν abu-025 ἐλπίδας κατῴκισα--Ρῑοῐῐμ Vinct.
