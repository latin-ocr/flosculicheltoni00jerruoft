3 16 PARAmss LosT.

T hough hard and rare. T hee Ι revisit safe‚
And feel thy sovereign vital lamp 3 but thou
Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain

To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn ;

So thick a drop serene hath queneh'd their orbs,
Or dim suffusion veil'd.

Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song 5 but chief
Thee‚ Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath‚
That wash thy hallow’d feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit ; nor sometimes forget
Those other two equall'd with me in fate,
So were I equall'd with them in renown,
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,
And Teiresias and Phineus, prophets old 3 ’
Then seed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers 3 as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling, and in shadie-st covert hid,
Tunes her nocturnal note.

MILTON.
