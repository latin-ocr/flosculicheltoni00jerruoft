14 PARADISE Los‘r.

Of us outcast‚ exiled, his new delight‚
Mankind created, and for him this world.

So farewell hope, and with hope farewell sear,
F arewell remorse ε all good to me is lost 3
Evil, be thou my g00d3 by thee at least
Divided empire with Heaven's King Ι hold,
By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign3 ’
As man ere long, and this new world shall know.

MILTON.
