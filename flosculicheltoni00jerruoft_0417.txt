CARTHAGE. 389

Mesh’d by suspicion and proverbial wile,
Self-tangled in the labyrinth of guile.

Farewell‚ we sigh'd—-a sad but short farewell :

Like some tall palm, which (Eastern stories
tell ²¹¹²)

Primeval youth from yet warm ashes claims‚
And dates its birth amid funereal flames,—
Like sorne tall palm her spring-tide hopes revive,
And glories past with future prospects strive.
A few short summers o'er her ruins slept‚
A few short winters o’er her ruins wept,
A few short years . . . her starry trine anon,
Its brief parenthesis † of darkness gone„
Ascendant gleams : not, as in days flown- by,
With lustre all its own, in majesty 3
But twinkling shyly round yon central sun,
Of all its galaxy the fairest one ;
Too glad perchance to catch one passing ray,
One spark of splendour that hath lost its way.
What? though her second youth no laurels grace,
Refinement clasps her in its soft embrace ;
About her brow, see, peaceful honours twine‚
As Wealth pays homage to the gentle Nine 5

⁴³ The Phoenicians gave the name of Phoenix to the palm-
tree‚ because when burnt down to the root, it rises again,
like that bird, sairer than ever.
† The writer has taken the liberty of appropriating this
bold expression from Storer—
“ ...... The short parenthesis of life was shor but
sweet.’'—Lifi¹ and Deatlz of Wolsey.
