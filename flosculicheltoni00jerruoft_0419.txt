THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

Ι “ Praise to the sturdy plough,
And patient spade : praise to the simple crook,
And ponderous loom !''-—W0R1)sw0RTH.

VOICES on the sounding ocean,
Voices'on the leaflet’s breast‚
Breathes it not in every motion
That old trussh—it cannot rest?
Angel-choristers in glory,
Coral—isles in purple seas,
Rising tell the sels-same story
To the music of the breeze.

Life is Labour! Life is Labour!
Not the lust of fame, of gold,
Not the might of sword and sabre‚

ι Not the battle, as of old,
But to live that neither sorrow
Vex us nor exceeding mirth,
'rhat the sun of every morrow
Rise upon a better earth Ξ
Onward, onward! Egypt beckons
Through the myriad mists of time,
