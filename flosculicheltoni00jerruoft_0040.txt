1 2 PARADISE LOST.

Still threat’ning to devour me opens wide,

To which the Hell Ι suffer seems a H eaven.

O then at last relent : is there no place

Left for repentance, none for pardon left?

N one left but by submission 3 and that word
Disdain sorbids me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneath whom I seduced

With other promises and other vaunts

Than to submit, boasting Ι could subdue

Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know

How dearly Ι abide that boast so vain,

Under what torments inwardly I groan,

While they adore me on the throne of Hell,

With diadem and sceptre high advanced,

The lower still Ι fall, only supreme

In misery 3 such joy ambition finds.

But say Ι could repent and could obtain

By act of grace my former state 3 how soon

Would height recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feign’d submission swore ? ease would recant
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.

For never can true reconcilement grow

Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep,
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse

And heavier fall: so should Ι purchase dear

Short intermission bought with double smart.

This knows my punisher: therefore as far

From granting he, as Ι from begging peace:
All hope excluded thus, behold instead
