ROMEO AND JULIET

ACT 1, Se. 1.
MONTAGUE. BENVOLIO. LADY MONTAGUE.

MoN. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew‚ were you by, when it began?

BEN. Here were the servants of your adversam,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part thern 3 in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared ;
Which, as he breathed defianee to my ears,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn :
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Carne more and more, and fought on part and part.
