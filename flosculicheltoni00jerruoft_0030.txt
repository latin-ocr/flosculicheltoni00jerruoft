FIRST PART OF

KING HENRY VI.

Aer 3, Sc, 3.

DUKE OF BURGUNDY. LA PUCELLE.

ΒΗΚ. Speak on, but be not over tedious.

Poe. Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
And see the cities and the towns defaced
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe 1
As looks the mother on her lowly babe,
When death doth close his tendet dying eyes,
See, see the pining malady of France.
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast 2
Ο, turn thy edged sword another way ς
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help 1
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's
bosom,
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign
gore3
Return thee, therefore, with a flood of tems,
And wash away thy country’s stained spots!
