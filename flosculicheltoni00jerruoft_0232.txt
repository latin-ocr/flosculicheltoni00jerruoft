ESSAY ΟΝ MAN

Book III.

LOOK round our world 3 behold the chain of love
Combining all below and all above.

See plastic nature working to this end,

The single atoms each to other tend,

Attract, attracted to, the next in place

F orm'd and impell'd its neighbour to embraee.
See matter next, with various life endued‚
Press to one centre still—the general good.
See dying vegetables life sustain,

See life dissolving vegetate again :

All forms that perish other forms supply,

(By turns we catch the vital breath and die.)
Like bubbles on the sea of matter born,
They rise, they break, and to that sea return.
Nothing is foreign 3 parts relate the whole 3
One all-extending, all-preserving sou]
Connects each being, greatest with the least ς
Made beast in aid of man, and man of beast ς
