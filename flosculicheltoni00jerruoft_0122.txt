94 THE ANCI ENT MARINER.

“And now the storm-blast came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong ;

He struck with his o’ertaking wings,
And chased us south along.

“And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold,

And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as emerald. ’

“And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen :

Nor shape of men, nor beast we ken—-
The ice was all between.

“The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around :

It crack'd and growl’d, and roar'd and howl'd‚

Like noises in a swound ἓ

“At length did cross an Albatross‚
Thorough the fog it came 3

As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hail'd it in God’s name.

‘·' It ate the food it ne’er had eat,
And round and round it flew.

The ice did split with a thunder—fit 3
The helmsman steer'd us through.
