24 HYPERION.

Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp 3

But horrors portion’d to a giant nerve

Ost made Hyperion ache. His palace bright

Bastion’d with pyramids of glowing gold,

And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks,

Glared a blood-red through all his thousand courts,

Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;

And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds

F lush’d angrily : while sometimes eagles’ wings,

Unseen before by gods or wondering men,

Darken'd the place 3 and neighing steeds were
heard,

Not heard before by gods or wondering men.

Also when he would taste the spicy wreaths

Of incense, breathed aloft from sacred hills,

Instead of sweets, his ample palate took

Savour of poisonous brass, and metal sick:

And so, when harbour’d in the sleepy west,

After the full completion of fair day,

For rest divine upon exalted conch,

And slumber in the arms of melody,

He paced away the pleasant hours of ease

With stride colossal, on from hall to hall 3

While far within each aisle and deep recess,

His winged minions in close clusters stood,

Amazed and full of sear 3 like anxious men

Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
