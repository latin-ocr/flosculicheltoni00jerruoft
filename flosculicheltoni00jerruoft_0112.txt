84 PARADISE Losr.

Magnificence 3 and what can Heaven show more Ρ
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our elements 3 these piercing fires
As soft as now severe, our temper changed
Into their temper 3 which must needs remove
The sensible of pain.

All things invite
To peaceful counsels, and the settled state
Of order, how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils, with regard
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite
All thoughts of war. Ye have what Ι advise.

He scarce had finish'd, when such murmur fill’d
Th’ assembly‚ as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blust’ring windS, which all night long
Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
Seafaring men o’erwatch’d‚ whose bark by chance,
Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay
After the tempest. Such applause was heard
As Mammon ended 3 and his sentence pleased‚
Advising peace : for such another field
They dreaded worse than hell ε so much the sear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within thern 3 and no less desire
To found this nether empire, which rnight rise
By policy‚ and long process of time,
In emulation opposite to Heaven.
