184 PARADISE LOST.

Now storming fury rose,
And clamour, such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never 3 arms on armour clashing bray’d
Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
Of brazen chariots raged 3 dire was the noise
Of conflict3 over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,
And flying vaulted either host with fire.
So under fiery eope together rush’d
Both battles main, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven
Resounded3 and had earth been then, all earth
Had to her centre shook. What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These elements‚ and arm him with the force
Of all their regions.

How much more of power
Army against army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy‚ their happy native seat 3
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent‚
From his stronghold of Heaven, high overruled

And limited their might. ’χ’ ²*

No thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
