254 MADoc IN AzTLAN. -

Or, rolling underneath us, makes earth rock
In tempest‚ and destroys the sons of men.
It was no sound of theirs‚ Ocellopan 1

No voice to hearten, for Ι felt it pass,
Unmanning every limb 3 yea, it relax’d
The sinews of my soul. Shedder of Blood,
Ι cannot list my hand against this man;
Go, if thy heart be stronger !''
