262 BISHOP HATTo.

Down on his knees the Bishop fell,

And faster and faster his beads did he tell,
As louder and louder‚ drawing near,

The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.

And in at the windows and in at the door,

And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,

And down through the ceiling, and up from the
floon

From the right and the left, from behind and before,

From within and without, from above and below,

And all at once to the Bishop they go.

They have whetted their teeth against the stones, ’
And now they pick the Bishop's bones;
They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,
For they were sent to do judgment on him.

SOUTHEY.
