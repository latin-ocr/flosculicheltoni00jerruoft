THE LOTUS EATERS.

THE Lotus blooms below the flowery peak ε

The Lotus blows by every winding creek:

All day the wind breathes low with mellow tone ε

T hrough every hollow cave and alley lone

Round and round the spicy downs the yellow
Lotus—(inst is blown.

We have had enough of action, and of motion we,

Roll'd to starboard‚ roll'd to larboard, when the
surge was Seething free,

Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam
fountains in the sea.

Let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal
mind,

In the hollow Lotus-land to live and lie reclined

On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.

For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are
hurl’d
