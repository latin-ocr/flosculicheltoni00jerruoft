224 LADY HERON’S SONG.

One touch to her hand, and one word 1n her ear, ’

When they reach' d the hall- door, and the charger‘
stood near3 ⁷

So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,

So light to the saddle before her he sprung!

“She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush‚ and.-

scaur :
They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,” quoth young*

Lochinvar.
