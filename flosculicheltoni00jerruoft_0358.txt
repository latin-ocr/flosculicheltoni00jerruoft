WHITE DOE OF RYLSTONE.

A glittering ship, that hath the plain
Of ocean for her own domain.

Lie silent in your graves, ye dead ἔ
Lie quiet in your churchyard bed l ”
Ye living, tend your holy cares 3
Ye multitude, pursue your prayers 3
And blame not me'if my heart and sight

ν Are occupied with one delight! ,

'Tis a work for Sabbath hours p ἱ
If Ι with this bright creature go :
Whether she be of forest bowers,

From the bowers of earth below,   , Δ . V

Or a spirit for one day given, ἱ ,
Α pledge of grace from purest heaven„

What harmonious pensive changes
Wait upon her as she ranges
Round and through this pile of state
Overthrown and desolate Ξ
Now a step or two her way
Leads through space of open day,
Where the enamour’d sunny light
Brightens her that was so bright 3
Now doth a delicate shadow fall,
Falls upon her like a breath‚
From some lofty arch or wall,
As she passes underneath:
Now some gloomy nook partakes
Of the glory that she makeS,—
