PARADISE REGAINED.

So saying, he caught him up, and without wing
Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,
Over the wilderness, and o'er the plain,

Till underneath them fair Jerusalem

The holy city lifted high her towers

And higher yet the glorious temple rear'd

Her pile, far off appearing like a mount

Of alabaster, topp'd with golden spires.

There on the highest pinnacle he set ¹

The Son of God, and added thus in scorn z·—

“There stand if thou wilt stand 3 to stand upright
Will ask thee skill 3 I to thy Father’s house
Have brought thee, and highest placed3 highest is

best 3 · ’

Now show thy progeny 3 if not to stand,
Cast thyself down 3 safely if Son of God 3
For it is written, He will give command
Concerning thee to his angels 3 in their hands
They shall uplift thee, lest at any time
Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.’'
