198 LAMENT Fon JAMES, EARL or GLENCAIRN.

“ Ye scatter'd birds that faintly sing,
’ The reliques of the vernal choir!

Ye woods that shed on a' the winds
The honours of the aged year!

A few short months, and glad and gay,
Again ye'll charm the ear and ee,

But nocht in all revolving time
Can gladness bring again to me.

‚ ‘I am a bending aged tree,
That long has stood the wind and rain:
But now has come a cruel blast,
And my last hald of earth ls gane.
Nae leaf o' mine shall greet the spring,
Nae simmer sun exalt my bloom3
But I maun lie before the storm,
And ithers plant them in my room.

‘⁶ I've seen sae monie changefu’ years,
On earth I am a stranger grown:
I wander in the ways of men
Alike unknowing and unknown :
Unheard, unpitied, unrelieved,
1 bear alane my lade o' care,
For silent, low, on beds of dust
Lie a’ that would my sorrows share.

‘⁶ And last (the sum of a’ my griefs 1)
My noble master lies in clay3
The flow'r amang our barons bold,
His country's pride, his country's stay:
