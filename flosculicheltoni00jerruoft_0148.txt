ULYSSES.

THERE lies the port ε the vessel puffs her sail :

There gloom the dark‚ broad seas. My mariners,

Souls that have toil' d and wrought and thought
with me—

That ever with a frolie welcome took

The thunder and the sunshine‚ and opposed

Free hearts‚ free foreheads—you and I are old:

Old age hath yet his honour and his toil z

Death eloses all ε but something ere the end,

Some work of noble note, may yet be done,

Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.

The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks :

The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the
deep

Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,-

'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

Push off and sitting well in order smite

The sounding furrows : for my purpose holds
