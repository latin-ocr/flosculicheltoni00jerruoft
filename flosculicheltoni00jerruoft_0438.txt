410 THE DEATH OF SOCRATES.

“ Yea, as the ocean-monsters, leagues from land,
Of upper splendours live unwittingly,

Wallowing a black bulk over boundless sand,
Deep in the gloom of sea 3

“ We to the blessed gods are such as they 3

In doubt and consternation draw we breath,
Sorrow o‘ur j0y, and darkness is our day,

>Yea, and our life is death.

-“ But when, at length, release from flesh is given,
From doubt and folly, and desire and fears,

Then shall the voieeful presences of heaven
Ring on bewilder'd ears 3

“ Then shall the true earth open on our sight,
And the true firmament above us shine,
And dwelling ever in that perfect light
We too shall be divine.''

He spake as babes who know not what they say 3
But if of men, O Lord, be good or bad,

Then (for he did desire to see Thy day)
He seeth, and is glad.

He ceased, nor wept 3 he drank the cup, nor quail’d3
The jailor stern stood sosten’d at his side 3

Then, as the force within him slowly fail'd,
He laid him down and died.
