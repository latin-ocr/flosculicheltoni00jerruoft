1 ο PARADISE Losr.

Would set me highest, and in a moment quit

The debt immense of endless gratitude,

So burdensome, still paying, still to owe,

Forgetful what from him I still received,

And understood not that a grateful mind

By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Α

Indebted and discharged 3 what burthen then?

O had his powerful destiny ordain’d

Me some inferior angel, I had stood

Then happy3 no unbounded hope had raised

Ambition. Yet why not? some other power

As great might have aspired .......

................ and me though mean

Drawn to his part 3 but other powers as great

Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within

Or from without, to all temptations arm’d.-

Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?

Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what to
accuse

But Heaven’s free love dealt equally to all?

Be then his love accursed‚ since'love or hate,

To me alike‚ it deals eternal woe.

Nay cursed be thou 3 sinceagainst his thy will

Chose freely what it now so justly rues.

Me miserable! which way shall I fly

Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?

Which way I fly is Hell ; myself am Hell;

And in the lowest deep a lower deep
