3 26 GUINEVERE.

To reverence the King, as if he were

Their conscience, and their conscience as their
King,

To break the heathen, and uphold the Christ,

To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,

To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,

To lead sweet lives in purest chastity‚ >

To love one maiden only, cleave to her,

And worship her byvyears of noble deeds‚

Until they won her 3 for indeed I knew

Of no mor‘e ‘subtle master under heaven

Than is the maiden passion for a maid,

Not only to keep down the base in man, q

But teach high thought, and amiable words,

And courtliness‚ and the desire of fame,

And love of truth, and all that makes a man.

And all this throve until I wedded thee,

Believing “ to mine helpmate, one to feel

My purpose and rej0icing in my j0y !''

TENNYSON. ’
