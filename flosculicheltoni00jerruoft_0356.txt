wfflTE DOE OF RYLSToNE,

A M'OMENT ends the fervent din,

And all is hush’d Without and within 3
For though the priest, more tranquilly,
Recites the holy liturgy,

The only voice which you ean hear

Is the river murmuring near.

When soft, the dusky trees between,
And down the path through the open green,
Where' ls no living thing to be seem ’ ’ ²
And through yon gateway, where ls found,
Beneath the arch with 1vy bound,

Free entrance to the churchyard ground—
Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,
Comes gliding in serene and slow,

Soft and silent as a dream,

A solitary doe 1

White she is as lily of June,

And beauteous as the silver moon,

When out of sight the clouds are driven,
And she ss left alone in heaven ;

Or like a ship some gentle day

In sunshine sailing far away,—
