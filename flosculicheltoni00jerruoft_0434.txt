406* BELISARIUS.

That I repent not aught which I have done.
J have not work’d my fall, but Destiny
And that serene pre-eminence of God.

Yet this I know, and with calamity

. Grows trust, and all unshaken confidence‚

T hat though men hold me poor, and blind, and
mean,

Cast down from honour, hopeless, desolate 3 '

Yet, in those generations far to come,

When they that spurn me from their palaces

Shall slumber with the unremember’d dead,

My fame shall broaden in the stream of time,
Wide-circling from my death-plunge, and a rumour,
And glorious memory of glorious deeds—

My deeds—-my deeds—shall ring through aster
tlme.’'

F. M.‚ 1858.
