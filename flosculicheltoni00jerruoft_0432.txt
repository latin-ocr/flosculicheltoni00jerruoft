404 BELISARms.

Dealt victor-justice to a humbled race,

And crush’d the yet rebelling Gelimer‚

And sail'd triumphant to Byzantium 3

And I was great among the sons of men.
Consul—a year sole Consul—every land
Knew me, and cringed an all-submissive neck
To the god-might of Belisarius.

Then, when Italia lay a wilderness,

Bared by the hurricane of civil war,

I' cross’d in hope the Adriatic blue,

Where emerald isles, inlaid in sapphire sea,
Gleam on the mariner, beach’d with rippled sand.
I cross'd in hope, and I return'd in glory;
For under the walls of old Parthenope

I fought, and, heralded by victory,

Ι carved a way to sometime royal Rome,
And, marching glorious to the Capitol,

Gave her once more a place among the nations.
Pent in the city by the unanimous might

Of fierce barbarians, with my own right hand
Ι wrought deliverance, wrought victory,

As he who, joying in his youth divine,

Strode all victorious to the farthest Ind,

And made the peoples know his sovereignty,
And was the monarch of the ringing world.

“How shall I tell of her, my pilot star,
Glorious adulteress, vile as beautiful,
Who not alone in plenitude of peace
Love-soften'd all this rugged warrior-heart,
