PROMETHEUS.

SPIRIT of Fancy, thou whose magic power

Can lure the soul from out its earthly cell,

To roam with Silence through the midnight hour
In scenes of vision'd beauty loved too well,

Too fondly, wildly 3 if thy wak’ning spell

Can still as once a mortal breast inspire,

Teach my adventurous Muse with thee to dwell
On scenes like those that hallow'd Hellas' lyre,
When glow'd each thrilling chord fraught with

undying fire.

Yes, for ’twas there that musing F ancy stray'd.
And woke her more than mortal melody‚
Seized on etherea] raptures, and display'd
Those deathless visions osan age gone by.
Fain would I linger o'er that Poesy‚
Till echo died into a dream 3-but no, -—
Far other scenes now claim the passing sigh,
Where Scythia's rocks frown through their veils
of snow,
And matchless Caucasus looks down on all below.
