288 DON RoDERmK.

Her own bright crescent, and the brighter 'face
It crown'd, reflected there.

Beside that spring
Count Julian’s tent was pitch'd upon the glade.
There his ablutions, Moor—like, he perform’d,
And, Moor-like, knelt in prayer. There was a

sound
Of voices at the tent when he arose,
And, lo l with hurried steps, a woman came
Toward him. Rightly then his heart presaged,
And, ere he could discern her countenance‚
Florimel knelt, and, with uplifted hands,
Embraced her sire. He raised her from the ground,
Kiss'd her, and clasp'd her to his heart, and said,
“Thou hast not then forsaken me, my child!
Howe'er the inexorable will of Fate
May, in the world which is to come, divide
Our everlasting destinies, in this
Thou wilt not, O my child, abandon me !’'
And then with deep and interrupted voice,
Nor seeking to restrain his copious tears,
“ My blessing be upon thy head,'' he cried,
“ A father's blessing! Though all faiths were false
It should not lose its worth !'' She lock'd her hands
Around his neck, and, gazing in his face
Through streaming tears, exclairn’d, ‘⁴ Oh, never
inore,

Here or hereafter, never let us part !”
And breathing then a prayer in silence forth,
The name of Jesus trembled on her tongue.
