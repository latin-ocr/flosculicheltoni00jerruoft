xviii PREFACE.

rather than vthe exercise itself. I think that,
especially in the first stages, verses should be much
more fully taught than is usually the case: ‘much
greater guidance and help should be, given, both in
the *actual process, and, even more, in suggestion
of method and principles. Perhaps this may, be
said of the process of instruction generally in our
English Schools. The general principle (which has,
Ι see, struck forcibly the French Commission of
“ Examination of the Secondary Instruction in
England and Scotland '') of making. the boy work
for himself, is undoubtedly* the right one. But it
may be, and Ι think it often is, carried much too
far3 boys waste hours of valuable time and energy
in blind efforts to attain what a few minutes’ teach-
ing would have enabled them to seize intelligently.
Especially however is this true of verse-making.
It is often a task‚ which seems utterly hopeless to
the beginner, and which yet, after the clue is once
given, becomes easy and pleasant. Under proper
circumstances I do not believe that the verses are
by any means the bugbear of the lower forms. ·My
own experience is, that in those forms boys take

more'int'erest in them, and mostly do them better,
than the prose exercises, which go on side by side
with them.
