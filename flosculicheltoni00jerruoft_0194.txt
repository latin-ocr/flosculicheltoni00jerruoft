166 KING RICHARD 11.

Dar’ st with thy frozen admonition Α

Make pale our cheek, ehasing the royal blood

With fury from its native residence.

Now by my seat' s right royal majesty‚

Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,

This tongue that runs so glibly in thine head

Should run thy head from thine unreverend
shoulders.

SHAKSPERE.
