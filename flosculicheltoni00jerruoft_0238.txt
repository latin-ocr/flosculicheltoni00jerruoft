HERMANN AND DORoTHEA·

AND the excellent youth collected himself as he
answer’d: Δ ”

“Truly no heart has he in his breast of iron who
feels not

Much for the lot of those, the men who are flying
their country.

No understanding has he who in times like these is
devoid of ¹

Anxious fears for himself and cares for the weal of
his country.

What Ι to-day have seen and heard has touched my
heart deep,

And now came I forth and saw this beauteous
wide-spread

Landscape, hills on fruitful hills all rising around
us ;

Saw hill nod to hill with the golden heads of the
com-field,

And the orchard promise abundant store for the
chamber.
