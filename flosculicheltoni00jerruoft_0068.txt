HYPERION

BOOK Π.

ALL eyes were on Enceladus’s face,

And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name
F lew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,

A pallid gleam across his features stem:

Not savage, for he saw full many a god

W roth as himself. He look’d upon them all,
And in each face he saw a gleam of light,

But splendider in Saturn's‚ whose hoar locks
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel,
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
In pale and silver silence they remain'd,

Till suddenly a splendour, like the mom,
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps‚

All the sad places of oblivion,

And every gulf and every chasm old,

And every height, and every sullen depth
Voioeless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams ;Ι
