42 HYPERION.

And all the everlasting cataracts‚

And all the headlong torrents far and near,
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade‚
Now saw the light, and made it terrible.

It was Hyperion—a granite peak

His bright feet touch'd‚ and there he stay'd to view
The misery his brilliance had betray’d

To the most hateful seeing of itself.

Golden his hair of short N umidian curl‚

Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade

In midst of its own brightness‚ like the bulk

Of Memnon’s image at the set of sun

To one who travels from the dusking east:

Sighs too as mournful as that Memnon's harp

He utter'd, while his hands, contemplative,

He press’d together, and in silence stood.
Despondence seized again the fallen gods

At sight of the dejected king of day,

And many hid their faces from the light:

But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes

Among the brotherhood 5 and at their glare ⁴

Up rose Iapetus, and Creus too,

And Phorcus sea-born, and together strode

To where he tower'd on his eminence.

There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name,
Hyperion from the peak loud answer'd “Saturn 1'’
