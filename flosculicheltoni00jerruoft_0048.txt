20 ROM Eo AND JULIET.

And makes himself an artificial night ε
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BEN. My noble uncle, do you know the cause'l
MON. Ι neither know it, nor can leam of him.
BEN. Have you importun’d him by any means?

MoN. Both by myself‚ and many other friends :
*But he, his own affection⁷s counselIor,

Is to himself—I will not say, how true—

But to himself so secret and so close,

So far from sounding and discovery,

As is the bud bit with an envious worm,

Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,

Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.

Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow‚
We would as willingly give cure, as know.

SHAKSPERE.
