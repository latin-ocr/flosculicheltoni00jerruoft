3 00 THOMAS THE RHYM ER.

In numbers high, the witching tale
The prophet pour'd along 3 Α

No after bard might e’er avail
Those numbers to prolong.

Yet fragments of the lofty strain
Float down thetide of years,
As, buoyant on the stormy main,

A parted wreck appears.

He sung King Arthur's T able Round: ,
The Warrior of the Lake 3 ·

How courteous Gawaine met the wound,
And bled for ladies' sake.

But chief in gentle Tristrem’s praise,
The notes melodious swell 3

Was none excell’d in Arthur's days,
The knight of Lionelle.

For Marke, his cowardly uncle's right,
A venom'd wound he bore3
When fierce Morholde he slew in sight,

'Upon the Irish shore.

No art the poison might withstand,
No medicine could be found,

Till lovely Isolde's lily hand
Had probed the rankling wound.
