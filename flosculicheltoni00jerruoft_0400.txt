372 GREECE.

Nature, triumphant o'er the power of Time,

Arrays in loveliness that fallen clime.

The lofty edifice in ruin lies-—

The flow’ret still smiles upward to the skies.
Hush'd is the lyre——yet ere its echoes die,

Fond Hope would raise sublimer minstrelsy 3

Would sweep the chords with more congenial lay,

And sing the glories of a happier day.

E’en now, unshackled by the Moslem chain,

See Greece her long-lost liberty regain 3

The haughty Soldan's tyranny is crush’d‚

The gleaming crescent trampled in the dust.

And shall imperial Hellas ne’er again

Renew the splendours of her ancient reign ? ·

The streaks that round her dark horizon play-—

Shall they not· spread and brighten into day ?

O Greeoe, awake Ξ recal thy past renown Ξ

Resume thy sceptre! claim thy long-lost crown 3

Burst through the shadows of surrounding gloom‚

And rise maj estic from Oblivion’s tomb !

T. B„ 1844
