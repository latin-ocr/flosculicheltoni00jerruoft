Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so

Doth valour's show, and valour's worth, divide,

In storms of fortune ε for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath mure annoyance by the brize

T han by the tiger 3 but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, and flies
F led under shade, why, then, the thing of courage,
As roused with rage, with rage doth sympafflize,
And, with an accent tuned in sels-same key,
Returns to chiding fortune.

U1„ Agamemnon,—
Thou great commander, n'erve and bone of Greece,
Heart of our numbers, soul, and only spirit,

In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.

SHAKSPERE.
