200 LAMENT FOR JAMES, EARL OF GLENCAIRN.

In weary being now I pine,
For a' the life of life is dead,
And hope has left my aged ken,
On forward wing for ever fied.

“ Awake thy last sad voice, my harp 1
The voice of woe and wild despair!
Awake ἔ resound thy latest lay,
Then sleep in silence evermair!
And thou my last, best, only friend,
T hat fillest an untimely tomb‚
Accept this tribute from the Bard
Thou brought from fortune’s darkest gloom.

‘⁴ [n poverty’s low barren vale
Thick mists obscure involved me round 3
T ho’ oft I cast the wistful eye
Nae ray of fame was to be found!
Thou found’st me like the morning sun
That melts the fogs in limpid air,
The friendless Bard and rustic son
Became alike thy fostvering care.

“ Oh! why has worth so short a date,
While villains ripen grey with time ?

Must thou, the noble, gen’rous, great,
Fall in bold manhood's hardy prime ?
