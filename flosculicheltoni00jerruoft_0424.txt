THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

Sing not now in warlike seeming
Blood-stain’d glories of the sight,
Brightly, as the levin, beaming,
Transient‚ as the levin’s light Ξ
Sing, ye poetS‚ tell, ye sages,
How in grandeur unconfined
To eternity of ages
Last the triumphs of the mind ε
And, ,ye great of every nation,
Labour’s scions spurn not now
Ye are great by man's creation:
Nobler circlet decks their brow :
Hands that sun and toil embrowneth—
Hands of toil despise not ye :
For the wreath of virtue crowneth
Nature's aristocracy 1

Not a breath of air o“n ocean :
Breezes all have sunk to sleep ⁶—
They that erst with scarce a motion
Trembling wander’d o'er the deep,—
Gentle as a wind at even, .
Hark l—perchance some angel-tone
Straying from the gate of heaven
Sends earth music, not her own :
Voices, as of angels—-voices
Softly sink and gently sweH,
And old Ocean's wave rejoices
At the sound he loves so well ε
