280 KING JOHN.

If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven 3
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
This proud contempt that beat his peace to heaven.

K. PHIL. Peace be to England, if that war return
From France to England‚ there to live in peace!
England we love 3 and for that England’s sake,
With burden of our armour here we sweat.

This toil of ours should be a work of thine 3
But thou from loving England art so far,

That thou hast underwrought his lawful king,
Cut off the sequence of posterity,

Outfaced infant state, and done a rape

Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.

Look here upon thy brother Geoffrey’s face:
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his ;
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geoffrey3 and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
That Geoffrey was thy elder brother born, ⁷
And this his son 3 England was Geoffrey’s right,
