HYPERION

B001< I.

UNT1L at length old Saturn lifted up

Hisfaded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,

And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,

And that fair kneeling Goddess ε and then spake
As with a palsied tongue‚ and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady :

“O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
Thea, I feel thee ere Ι see thy face ε
Look up, and let me see our doom in it :
Look up, and tell meis this feeble shape
, Is Saturn's ; tell me if thou hear’st the voice
Of Saturn : tell me if this wrinkling brow,
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power
To make me desolate? Whence came the strength?
How was it nurtured to such bursting forth,
While Fate seem’d strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so 3 and I am smother’d up,
And buried from all god-like exercise
