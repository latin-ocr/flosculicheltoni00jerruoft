246 HIAWATHA.

Stronger still grew Hiawatha,

Till the darkness fell around them,
And the Heron, the Shuh-Shuh-gah,
From her haunts among the sen—lands,
Gave a cry of lamentation‚

Gave a scream of pain and famine.

“ ’Tis enough,'' then said Mondamin,
Smiling upon Hiawatha,

‘⁴ But to-morrow, when the sun sets,
Ι will come again to try you.’'

And he vanish’d, and was seen not3
Whether sinking as the rain sinks,
Whether rising as the mists n‘se,
Hiawatha saw not, knew not,

Only saw that he had vanish'd,
Leaving him alone and sainting,
With the misty lake below him

And the reeling stars above him.

LONGFELLOW.
