THE SACK OF ROME ΒΥ ALARIC. 419

To mourn for these in joy for what remainS‚—-
Lucretius' muse, and Virgil's graceful Stratius,
And Tully's burning eloquence, and all

That wondrous code by which, despite her fall,
E'en now she reigns a Queen imperial 3

For though her palaces in ruins lie,

And though her sons are sunk in slavery‚
Rome is a light to all etemity !

J. H. B„ 1866.
