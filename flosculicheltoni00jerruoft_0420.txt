THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

Points to Sphinx and temple—reckons
How she labour'd at her prime :
Memory's moonlight wanders o'er me,

Memory, like the breathing* shell,
Still around me, still before me, ’
Breathes a retrospective knell :
Shapes of crumbling fane and temple,
Shapes of hoary pyramid
Rise, where Nile with many a dimple
CreepS‚ by reeds and rushes hid,
Rise‚ and rising in their glory,
Softly‚ gently‚ seem to say,
They too singing Labour's story,
“ Toil shall never pass away:
Stone may crumble, man may perish,
Every trace may die away,
Yet the smile of Eld will cherish

Memory's halo round deeay1’'

Sleepless as the march of ages,
Fruitful as the wealthy soil,

Like the hope that youth presages,
Sanguine ever—such is Toil l

“ I have seen
A curious child who dwelt upon a tract
Of inland ground, applying to his ear
The convolutions of a smooth-lipp'd shell ε
To which, in silence hush'd, his very soul
Listen’d intensely τ and his countenance soon
Brighten'd with joy: for from within were heard
Murmurings‚ whereby the monitor express'd
Mysterious union with its native sea.’'— Wrdmorth.
