296 . FAERIE' ‘QUEEN · 5·

To which the damzelL· fall of doub'tfull thought,
Her mildly answer'd: “ Beldame‚ be not wroth
With silly virgin, by adventure tbrought
Unto your dweHing, ignorant and loth,

That crave but rowme to rest while tempest
overblo’th.''

With that adowne out of her christall eyne
Few trickling teares she softly forth let fa11‚2-
That like two orient perles did purely shyne ¹ .
Upon her snowey cheeke 3 and therewithall
. She sighed sost, that none so bestiall ·
Nor salvage hart but ruth of her sad plight
Would make to melt, or pitteously >appan 3
And that vile hag, all were her whole delight
In mischiefe, was much moved at so pitteous sight.'’
