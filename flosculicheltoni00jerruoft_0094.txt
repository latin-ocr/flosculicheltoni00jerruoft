KING RICHARD III

ACT 3, Sc. 7.

DUKE oF BUCKINGHAM. DUKE OF GLo’STER.
MAvoR. CATESBY.

BUCK. Know, then, it is your fault, that you
resign

The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The sceptred office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemish’d stock:
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
(Which here we waken to our country’s good,)
, The noble isle doth want her proper limbs
Her face defaced with scars of infamy‚
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder’d in the swallowing gulf
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solieit
Your gracious sels to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land ε
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain 3
