ARIADNE.

WHERE art thou, Theseus? Theseus 1 Theseus !
where ?

Why hast thou stolen thus with earliest dawn

Forth from thy couch——forth from these faithless
arms,

That e’en in slumber should have clasp’d thee still?

Truant, ah me 1 and hast thou learnt to fly

So early from thy Ariadne's love?

Where art thou? Is it well to fright me thus-—

To scare me for a moment with the thought

Of one abandon'd? Art thou in the woods

With all that could have told me where thou art?

Cruel 2 and could’st thou not have left me one

Ere this to have laugh'd away my idle fears?

He could have told thee all—-the start, the shriek,

The pallid face with which I found thee gone—

And fumish’d laughter for thy glad return.

But thus to leave me, cruel Ξ thus alone 1

There is no sound of horn among the hius,

No shouts that tell they track or bay the boar.
