238 ROMEO AND JULlET.

To—morrow night look that thou lie alone,

Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this phial, being then in bed,

And this distilled liquor drink thou off,

When presently through all thy veins shall run “
Α cold and drowsy humour ς for no pulse

Shall keep his native progreSS‚ but surcease ι

No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou liv'st ;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade

To paly ashes 5 thy eyes' windows fall V

Like death when he shuts up the day of life3
Each part deprived of supple government Β
Shall, stiff, and stark‚ and cold‚ appear like death ;
And, in the borrow’d likeness of shrunk death,
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,

And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes

⁸· To rouse thee from thy bed, there thou art dead 3

Then (as the manner of our country is),
In thy best robes, uncover'd on the bier,
Be borne to burial in thy kindred's grave 3

Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault‚ ¹
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
