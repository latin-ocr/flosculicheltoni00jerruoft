26 HYPERION.

When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
Even now, while Saturn, roused from icy nance,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,

Came slope upon the threshold of the west 3
Then, as was wont‚ his palace door flew ope

In smoothed silence, save what solemn tubes,
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
And wandering sounds‚ slow-breathed melodies 3
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape‚

In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,

That inlet to severe magnificence

Stood full-blown‚ for the god to enter in.

KEATS.
