418 THE SACK or ROME ΒΥ ALARIC.

With glittering peaks and spires of rainbow 1ight,

But deep beneath the warm waves undermine

The aerial mountain, till it topples o’er,

And down with lightning flash and awful roar

Dash its wild crags and headlong precipices,

And high the foam in sheeted torrents hisses,

And circling round and round in wild affright,

Darkening the moon, the sereaming wild-fowl
soar,

And their harsh clamour all the ocean o‘er

Shrills upward echoing through the silent night, —-

So fell the imperial city. Statue, bust,

Column and sculptured frieze, that wont to dart

The flame which wrought them through the gazer's
beart,

Palace, and arch, and bath, and portico,

And those old walls that echoed Cicero

A thousand times, with many a barbarous blow

And many a yell from off their basements thrust‚

Are dash'd to thousand atoms in the gory dust.

But though the Forum lies a ruin'd heap,

Mock'd by a stately column here and there,

And though the owl hoots, and the rank weeds
creep

From stone to stone upon the Palatine,

Where dwelt the Emperor, and creepers twine

The Coliseum's broken arches, where

The full-faced moon through ivy’s tangled hair

Gazes on desolation, let us spare
