268 LORD OF THE ISLES.

We saw her from the mountain head,

When, with St. George’s blazon red,

A southern vessel bore in sight,

And yours raised senil, and took to ssight.”—

, “ Now, by the rood, unwelcome news 1”
Thus with Lord Ronald communed Bruce 3
‘⁴ Nor rests there light enough to show
If this their tale be true or no.

⁷ The men seem bred of churlish kind,

Yet mellow nuts have hardest rind 3

We will go with them—food and fire

And sheltering roof our wants require.
Sure guard 'gainst treachery will we keep,
And wateh by turns our comrades’ sleep.—
Good feIIows, thanks 3 your guests we’ll be,
And we will pay the courtesy.

Come lead us where your lodgings lie—
Nay, soft Σ we mix not company,—

Show us the path o'er crag and stone,

And we will follow you—lead on. ”

ScorT.
