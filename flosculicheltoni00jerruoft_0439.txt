THE DEATH OF SOCRATES. 411

Nor did he at the last at all recoil,
Nor rail'd at all upon malignant foes,

But cheerfully seem'd passing from long toil
To some serene repose.

And o’er his death a smile stole silently‚
Telling of constant calm, of holy trust 3
For who shall wait with purer heart than he

The rising of the just?

ΕΠΙΓΡΑΜΜΑ..

Not any builded shrine, since breath began,
Was half so sacred, stranger‚ as this sod ;

For underneath is the most righteous man
That ever knew not God.

F. M.‚ 1860.
