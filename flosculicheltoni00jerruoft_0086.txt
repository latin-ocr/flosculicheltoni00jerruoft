HvMN ΟΝ THE sEASONs.

THESE, as they change, Almighty F ather, these
Are but the varied God. The rolling year

Is full of Thee. F orth in the pleasing Spring
Thy beauty walks, Thy tenderness and love—-
Wide fiush the fields 3 the softening air is balm ;
Echo the mountains round ; the forest smiles ;
And every sense and every heart is joy.

Then comes Thy glory in the Summer months,
With light and heat refulgent. Then Thy sun
Shoots full perfection through the swelling year 3
And oft Thy voice in dreadful thunder speaks 3
And oft at dawn, deep noon, or falling eve,

By brooks and groves, in hollow-whispering gales„
Thy bounty shines in Autumn unconfined‚

And spreads a common feast for all that lives,

In Winter awful Thou 1 with clouds and storms
Around Thee thrown‚ tempest o’er tempest roll’d,
Majestic darkness 1 on the whirlwind's wing‚
Riding sublime, Thou bidd’st the world adore,
And humblest nature with Thy northern blast.
