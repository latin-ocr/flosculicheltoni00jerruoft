3 36 v1RG1N MARTYR(

My last of pleasures in this happy object,
That I shall e'er be bless'd with.

THEOPH. Now, proud contemnet
Of us, and of our Gods, tremble to think
It is not in the power thou serv’st to save thee 3
Not all the riehes of the sea, increased
By violent shipwrecks, nor the unsearch’d mines,
(Mammon’s unknown exchequer,) shall redeem
’ thee.
And, therefore, having first with horror weigh’d
What ’tis to die, and to die young: to part with*-
All pleasures and delights: lasfly, to go
Where all antipathies to comfort dwell 3(
F uries behind7 about thee, and before thee ;
And to add to affliction‚ the remembrance
Of the Elysian joys thou might'st have tasted,
Hadst thou not turn'd apostate to those Gods
T hat so reward their servant53 let despair
Prevent the hangman’s sword‚ and on this scaffold
Make thy first entrance into hell.

ANT. She smiles ἕ
Unmoved by Mars, as if she were assured
Death, looking on her constancy‚ would forget
The use of his inevitable hand.

THEopff Dared too! Despatch, I say.
