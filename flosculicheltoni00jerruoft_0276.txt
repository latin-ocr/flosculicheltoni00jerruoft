MADoc IN AZTLAN.

AFTER a way

Circuitous and long through lonely tracks‚

They reach'd the mountains‚ and amid the shade
Of thickets coven'ng the uncultured slope

Their patient ambush placed. The Chiefs alone
Held on, till, winding in ascent, they reach’d
The heights which o’er the Briton's mountain hold
Impended 3 there they stood, and by the moon,
Who yet, with undiminish'd lustre‚ hung

High in the dark blue firmament‚ from thence
Explored the deep descent. Precipitous

The rock beneath them lay, a sudden eliff

Bare and unbroken3 in its midway holes,

Where never hand could reach, or eye intrude,
The eagle built her eyrie. Farther on,

Its interrupted crags and ancient woods

Offer'd a difficult way. From erag to crag,
’ By rocky shelf, by trunk, or root, or bough,

A painful toil and perilous„ they pass’d 3

And now, stretch’d out amid the matted shrubs
