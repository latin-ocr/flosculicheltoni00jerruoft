GREECE. 3 65

The eager hunter sought the plains to roam,
And bore the prey exulting to his home 3
While his loved craft the fisherman pursued
Beside the stream in tranquil solitude.
To all alike an ample share was given
Of its kind favours by an equal Heaven.

Yet fair though ancient Hellas rose to·sight,
Encircled with a crown of peerless light,
Prostrate she bow'd to pagan Error's reign,
And crouch'd a slave beneath the tyrant’s chain.
Each scene th' Eternal bounteously had blest,
On each the footprints of His might imprest3
All seem’d a gracious Deity's abode 3
All own'd the empire of a present God 3
Still could not man to Him his thoughts upraise,
Nor e’er to Him burst forth the song of praise.
*Yet noble gods thy children, Hellas, own’d,
On proud Olympus' heights who dwelt enthroned,
Whence, though invisible to mortal sight,
Pavilion’d in the shrines of mystic light,
They moved the springs of Nature's complex plan,
And ruled the destinies of subject man.
The varied acts of the eternal mind
To separate deities were then assign’d.
They saw a God amid the lightning's shine,
In roaring thunders heard a voice divine.
The rippling streams a hallow'd sway confest,
And gales that laugh’d in Evening’s glowing breast.
Whirlwinds and storms obey’d their sovereign dread,
And Ocean heaved beneath a monarch⁷s tread.
