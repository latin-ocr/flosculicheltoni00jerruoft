BISHOP BRUNO.

BISHOP Bruno awoke in the dead midnigffi,
And he heard his beart beat loud with affright ;
He dreamt he had rung the palace bell

And the sound it gave was his passing knell.

Bishop Bruno smiled at his fears so vain,

He turn'd to sleep and he dreamt again :

He rang at the palace gate once more,

And Death was the porter that open'd the door.

He started up at the fearful dream,

And he heard at his window the screech-owl scream ἒ
Bishop Bruno slept no more that night 3

Oh! glad was he when he saw the daylight.

Now 116 goes forth in proud array,

For he with the Emperor dines to-day 3
There was not a Baron in Germany,
That went with a nobler train than he.
