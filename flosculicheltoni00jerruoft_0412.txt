3 84 CARTHAGE.

Eaeh fragrant balm of Araby the blest

⁴Wept tears of frankincense at her behest ;

Oman ²* with pearl bedropp'd her glist'ning shore,
And far Sofala teem’d with golden ore :--·

Sofala pregnant by the yellow ray,

With which the new-born *Emperor of day }
Greets his own clime, and smiles its night away.

The hills have donn’d their verdant robes again,
The virgin lea resumed its gladsome reign 1
Nor princely hall is found, nor pillar’d fane,
Unblest intruders on the fair domain,
But grass-grown blocks, and prostrate shrines
that seem
The last faint relies of a splendid dream 3

‚ Where now Tunisia's budding bosom † woos

Th’ embrace of Ocean with her sun-bright hues—2-
With hues as bright as when in days of yore, ’
She, whom e'en yet Tunisia’s maids adore ζ,
That augury with pious rapture hail'd,

Strange firstling boon by Libya’s soil unveil’d—

ἅ The Persian Gulf, sometimes so called.

† The coast of Tunis consists of a low plain of the greatest
fertility, which here and there swells into graceful eminences,
and presents from the sea-side a most enchanting spectacle.
—Morier's T ravels.

‡ The love, the missortunes, and the death of Elissa, still
form the theme of one of the most plaintive songs of the
Moorish maids ; and the ‘⁶ Anna Perenna'' of Ovid still lives
under the more musical name of Ayadfi in the mouth 01
many a daughter of the sun. —D’Herbel0t.
