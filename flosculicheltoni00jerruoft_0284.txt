BISHOP HATTO.

THE Summer and Autumn had been so wetâ€š
That in Winter the corn was growing yet.
'Twas a piteous sight to see all around

The grain lie rotting on the ground.

Every day the starving poor

Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door,
For he had a plentiful last year's store,
And all the neighbourhood could tell

His granaries were furnish'd well.

At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day

To quiet the poor without delay3

He bade them to his great barn repair,

And they shall have food for the Winter there.

Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,

The poor flock flock'd from far and near3
The great barn was full as it could hold

Of women and children, and young and old.
