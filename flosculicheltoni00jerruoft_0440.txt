THE SACK OF ROME BY
ALARIC.

‘⁴ O marvailous great change 3
Rome living was the world's sole ornament,
And dead is now the world’s sole moniment !''——SPENSER.

ALAS for Rome, the Rome that is no more,

The dauntless soul, the ever-ready hand,
The patriot beart, that held it sweet to pour

Its dearest life-blood for its native land,

The fire of high ambition, conquest-fann’d‚
The iron will that nought could turn away

From strictest duty, matchless to command,
Matchless to suffer, matchless to obey,

The consuls, and their legions, and the band
Of hoary-bearded Fathers, where are they?
Gone all, and gone for ever. N ever more
The long triumphal pomp shall slowly wend
With snowy victims on the Saered ⁴Way,

With priceless spoils and captives as of yore,

Nor see on high the old Tarpeian blaze
With glittering roof, all-golden, nor ascend

The steep of marble as in other days ε
For all thy triumphs now, alas 1 are o'er

For ever, and thy glory hath an end Ξ
