effi· fiss, CANT. iii.

OVER the joyous feast the sudden darkness de-
scended.

All was silent without, and illuming the landscape
with silver

F air rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars, but
within doors

Brighter than these shone the faces of friends in
the glimmering lamplight:

Then from his station alost, at the head of the
table, the herdsman

Pour’d forth his heart and his wine together in
endless profusion :

Then he spake to his guests‚ who listen'd, and
smiled as they listen'd—

ss‘Welcome once more, my friends, who so long
have been friendless and homeless— ’

Welcome once more to a land which is better,
perchance, than the old one.
