Turn ye and gaze ε yon mountain's hoary erest

Supports a god upon its icy throne 3

Tempests have mantled fiercely round his breast‚

Till Terror crouch'd “to mark what deeds were
done ;”

Yet would he still undaunted smile upon

The storm, and view a spirit in the blast,

Sublime, unbridled‚ mighty as his own 3

>And woo the lightnings as they quiver'd past,

To rive the chains that bound his tortured body

fast.

Silent he stands 3 words, tears are far too
weak

To tell the burning grief that rankles there 3

Yet shall Prometheus never bend to seek

A tyrant’s pardon by a coward's prayer 3

Years have beheld him fetter’d, yet Despair

Hath writ no line upon that haughty brow‚

Undimm'd by suffering, and untamed by care ;

Here stern Defiance flashes but to show

How bright‚ how fierce the soul that burns un·

quench'd below.

Still oft perchance would pensive Memory sigh
To live the hours of bygone joy again ς

Yet all unmoved the calmness of his eye,
Albeit his heart more keenly felt the pain :
