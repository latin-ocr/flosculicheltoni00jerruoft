3 22 LAODAMIA.

Yet bitter‚ ofttimes bitter, was the pang
When of thy loss I thought, beloved Wife!
On thee too fondly did my memory hang,
And on the joys we shared in mortal life 3-
The paths which we had trod,—-these fountainS,
flowers‚— ¹
My new-plann'd cities, and unfinish’d towers.

But, should suspense permit the foe to cry,
Behold 1 they tremble I—haughty their array 3
Yet of their number no one dares to die Ρ-
In soul I swept the indignity away:
Old frailties then recurr’d 3 but lofty thought,
In act embodied‚ ‘my deliverance wrought.

And thou, though strong in love, art all too weak
In reason, in sels-government too slow 3
I counsel thee by fortitude to seek
Our blest reunion in the shades below;
The invisible world with thee hath sympathized ς
Be thy affections raised and solemnized.

WORDSWORTH.
