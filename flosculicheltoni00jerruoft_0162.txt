From chaos and parental darkness came

Light‚ the first fruits of that intestine broil,

T hat sullen ferment which for wondrous ends

VVas ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,

And with it light, and light engendering

Upon its own pmducer, forthwith touch'd

The whole enormous matter into life.

Upon that very hour our parentage,

The Heavens and the Earth were manifest.

Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race

Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.

Now comes the pain of truth‚ to whom ’tis pain 3

O folly! for to bear all naked truths‚

And to envisage circumstance, all calm,

That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!

As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far

Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once
chiefs 3

And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth

In form and shape compact and beautiful,

In will, in action free, companionship

And thousand other signs of purer life3

So on our heels a fresh perfection treadS,

A power more strong in beauty, born of us

And fated to excel ηε, as we pass

In glory that old darkness ; nor are we

Thereby more conquer'd than by us the rule
