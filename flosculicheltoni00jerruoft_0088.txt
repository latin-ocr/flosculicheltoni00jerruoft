60 HYMN ON THE SEASONS.

Mysterious round l what skill, what force divine,
Deep felt, in these appear 1 a simple train, ¹
Yet so delightful, mix’d with such kind art,

Such beauty and beneficence combined,

Shade unperceived so sostening into shade,

And all so forming an harmonious whole,

That‚ as they still succeed‚ they ravish still.

But wandering oft, with brute unconscious gaze,
Man marks not T hee, marks not the mighty hand
That, ever busy, wheels the silent spheres‚

Works in the secret deep, shoots, steaming, thence
The fair profusion that o’erspreads the spring3
Flings from the sun direct the flaming day 3
Feeds every creature, hurls the tempest forth,
And, as on earth this grateful change revolveS,
With transport touches all the springs of life.

Nature, attend 1 join, every living soul
Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,
In adoration join: and ardent, raise
One general song 1 To Him, ye vocal gales,
Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness

breathes 3

Oh, talk of Him in solitary glooms,
Where, o’er the rock, the scarcely waving pine
Fills the brown shade with a religious awe Ξ
And ye whose bolder note is heard afar,
Who shake the astonish’d world, list high to heaven
The impetuous song, and say from whom you rage.
His praise, ye brooks, attune, ye trembling rills ;
