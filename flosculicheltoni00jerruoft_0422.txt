394 THE PRAISE OF LABOUR.

Labour 'weans us from disunion,
Welds the nations into one,

Flashes mankind into union,
Union glorious as the sun :

Vainly mountain, vainly river,
Vainly oceans intervene‚

Let the rivers roll for ever,
Let the mountains rise between,

Labour rises o’er the mountains‚
Travels dryshod o'er the seas,

Tracks the rivers to their fountains
In the far Antipodes.

“ Semper eadem ” in all ages,
Changing not in changing clime,
Summer’s heat and ‘⁶ Winter’s ranges‚''
Labour triumphs over Time z
Not destruction but creation—
Labour links with silver span
Nation closely unto nation‚
And man closely unto man ε
Not destruction but creation—
Thine are not the steps of War
Levelling in annihilation ’
Every thing that was before—-
Trampling out with fiery traces
Footsteps of preceding toil,
As the ocean-wave effaces
F ootprints on a sandy soil ;
