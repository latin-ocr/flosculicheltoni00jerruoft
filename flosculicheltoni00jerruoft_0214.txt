1 86 PARADISE LosT.

That argued sear 3 each on himself relied,

As only on his arm the moment lay ’

Of victory. Deeds of eternal fame

Were done, but infinite 3 for wide was spread
That war and various 3 sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,
Tormented all the air 3 all air seem'd then
Conflicting fire.

Long time in even scale
The battle hung3 till Satan, who that day
Prodigious power had shown and met in arms
No equal, ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused at length
Saw where the sword of Michael smote and fell'd
Squadrons at once 3 with huge two-handed sway
Brandish'd alost, the horrid edge came down
Wide-wasting 3 such destruction to withstand
He hasted‚ and opposed the rocky orb
Of tensold adamant, his ample shield,
‚ A vast circumference. At his approach
The great Archangel from his warlike toil
Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end
Intestine war in Heaven, the Arch-foe subdued,
Or captive dragg'd in chains, with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began.

MILTON.
