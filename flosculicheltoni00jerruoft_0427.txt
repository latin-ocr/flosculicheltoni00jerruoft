THE PRAISE OF LABOUR. 399

With their thousand acclamations

Chorus up to Heaven the song 3
‘⁴ Life is Labour! Life is Labour!

Not the lust of fame, of gold,
Not the might of sword and sabre,
Not the battle, as of old,
But to live that neither sorrow
Vex us nor exceeding mirth,
That the sun of every morrow
Rise upon a better earth !’'

W. L. N.‚ 1852.
