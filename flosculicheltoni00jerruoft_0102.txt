THE FATAL SISTERS.

Now the storm begins to lower,
(Haste the loom of Heu prepare,)

ν Iron sleet of arrowy shower

Hurtles in the darken’d air.

Glittering lances are the loom
Where the dusky warp we strain,

Weaving many a soldier’s doom,
Orkney's woe and Randver’s bane.

See the grisly texture grow,
(’Tis of human entrails made 3)
And the weights that play below,
Each a gasping warrior's head.

Shafts for shuttles‚ dipt in gore,
Shoot the-trembling cords along ;

Sword, that once a monarch bore,
Keep the tissue close and strong.
