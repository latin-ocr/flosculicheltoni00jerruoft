 

164 ’ KING RICHARD 11.

GAUNT. Now He that made me knows Ι see
thee ill,

Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.

Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,

Wherein thou liest in reputation sick 3

And thou, too careless patient that thou art,

Committ’st thy anointed body to the cure

Of those physicians who first wounded thee.

A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,

Whose eompass is no bigger than thy head 3

And yet, eneaged in so small a vergo,

The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.

Oh 1 had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye

Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,

From forth thy reach he would have laid thy
shame,

Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,

Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.

Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,

It were a shame to let this land by lease3

ι But for the world enjoying but this land,

Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England art thou now—not king
Thy state of law is bond-slave to the law 3
And thou

 

R1cH. A lunatio, lean—witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
