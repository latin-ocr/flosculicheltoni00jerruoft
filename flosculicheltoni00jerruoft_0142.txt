HYPERION

BOOK III.

THROUGHOUT all the isle
There was no covert‚ no retired cave
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
He listen‘d, and he wept‚ and his bright tears ⁵
Went trickling down the golden bow he held 3
Thus with half-shut, suffused eyes he stood,
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
With solemn step an awful Goddess came,
And there was purport in her looks for him,
Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplex’d : the While melodiously he said ε
“How camest thou over the unfooted sea?
Or hath that antique mien and robed form,
Moved in these vales invisible till now?
Sure Ι have heard those vestments sweeping o'er
The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone
In cool mid forest. Surely Ι have traced
The rustle of those ample skirts about
These grassy solitudes‚ and seen the flowers
Lift up their heads as still the whisper pass'd.
