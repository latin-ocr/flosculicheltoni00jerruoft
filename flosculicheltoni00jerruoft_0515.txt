in the hands os pupils and tutors. But our
examination of the instalment of, we hope,
a complete ‘ Sophocles,’ which Mr. Jebb has

put forth, has assured us that this is a.

needless suspension of judgment, and
prompted us to commit the justifiable rash-
ness os pronouncing upon its contentS, and
of asserting aster due rusal that it is
calculated to be admira ly serviceable to

every class of scholars and learners. And
this assei-tion is based upon the fact that it
is a by no means one-sided edition, and
that it looks as with the hundred eyes of
Argus, here, there, and ever where, to keep
the reader from straying.‘ n a concise and
succinet style of English annotation‚ forming
the best substitute for the time-honoured
Latin notes which had so much to do with
making good scholars in days os yore, Mr.
Jebb keeps a steady eye sor all questions os
grammar, construction, scholarship‚ and
philology, and handles these as they arise
with a helpsul and sufficient precision. In
matters of grammar and syntax his practice
sor the most part is to refer his reader to
the proper section of Madvig's ‘ Manual of
Greek Syntax:’ nor does he ever waste
space and time in explainingaconstruction,
unless it be such an one as is not satis-
factorily dealt with in the grammars of
Madvig or Jelf. Experience as a pupil
and a teacher has probably taught him the
value of the wholesome task of hunting out
a grammar reference for oneself, instead os
finding it, handy sor slurring over, amidst
the hundred and one pieces of information
in a voluminous foot-note. But whenever
there occurs any peculiarity of construction,
which is hard to reconcile to the accepted
usage, it is Mr. jebb’s general practice to
be ready at hand with mansu} assistance.”

“Mr. ebb’s Edition of the Ajax in the
C alena classicorum ought to assure those
who have hitherto doubted that this is a
Series to adopt. Like his edition os the
‘ Electra' this of the ‘Ajax' is ably and
usesully handled. The Introduction alone
would prove the wide reading, clear views,
and acute criticism os its writer.”—Churcl1-
