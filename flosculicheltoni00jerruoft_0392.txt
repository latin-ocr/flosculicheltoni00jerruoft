364 GREECE.

Each lonely forest, each enamell’d plain
Has heard the echoes of some minstrel strain 3
Each fertile vale has waked a poet’s song,
Each stream, that glides those fertile vales along,
Each mountain glistening in the morning ray
Or crimson’d 'neath the dying fiush of day.
Fond Memory calls each scene her own abode‚
And musing Fancy hallows every sod.
Queen of the lyre Ξ thy magic aid bestow Ξ
Ι11 rapturous fervour bid the strain to glow 1
Assist the muse her soaring flight to wing
And heavenly Poesy's own clime to sing 1

When o'er the world primeval Nature smiled
And sought what land to own her fairest child,
ln kindly prescience of the future hour
On Greece she pour'd her richest‚ loveliest dower ;
And every gift to grace the soil combined
Where Art and Science should ere long be shrined.
The verdant landscape with delighted gaze
η The rustic viewing glow’d with grateful praise,
And fondly deem'd, so lovely all around‚
That there the gods 311 earthly heaven had found.
The wanderer, forced by cruel need to roam
And seek in foreign elimes a kinder home,
View'd the fair shores, and, fill'd with glad surprise,
F orgot his country ’neath the genial skies.
Contented then they prized the humble store
Which Nature gave, nor ask'd nor wish'd for more.
The willing soil supplied their daily need,
And yielded herbage where their flocks might seed.
