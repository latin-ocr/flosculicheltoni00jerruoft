408 THE DEATH OF soCRATEs.

So men arraign'd the saint of blasphemy ;
The sage arraign'd they of corrupting youth ;
Arraign'd the saint whose life was purity—
The sage whose speech was truth.

But rather in that chance he did reJ'oice,
Yea, set to blessings that calamity3
And, doubting nothing, made heroic choice—
‚ As he had lived—to die.

Nor bated aught of blameless innocence,
Nor courted any pity of the strong 3

But, dauntless ever in a great defenee‚
He cried against the wrong.

Nor might he not foreshadow One to be,

Dragg’d downward by the race He came to save,
Through bitterer scorn, unjuster contumely,

Down to a nobler grave.

Or as that cloud of faithful witnesses

March’d cheerfully on torture and on sword,
Expecting after any agonies

The coming of the Lord ε

So look’d he on his judges, witting well
Their sorest penalty must bring release

In such an end as theirs who nobly fell
Before the gates of Greece.
