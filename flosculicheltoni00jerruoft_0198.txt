170 GONDOLINE.

And all within was dark and drear,
And all without was calm 3

Yet Gondoline enter'd—her soul upheld
By some deep-working charm.

And as 5116 enter’d the cavern wide,
The moonbeam gleamed pale,

And she saw a snake on the craggy roek.
It hung by its slimy tail.

Her foot it slipp'd and she stood aghast‚
She trod on a bloated toad 3

Yet still upheld by the secret charm,
She kept upon her road.

And now upon her frozen ear
Mysterious sounds arose 3

So on the mountain's piny top,
The blustering north wind blows.

Then furious peals of laughter loud

W ere heard with thundering sound, .
Till they died away in soft decay,

Low whispering o'er the ground.

Yet still the maiden onward went,
The charm yet onward led,

T hough each big glaring ball of sight
Seem'd bursting from her head.
