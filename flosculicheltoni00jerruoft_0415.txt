CARTHAGE. 3 87

And conquest beck'ning frorn th' Helvetian steep,

Waves his red plumes in blazon broad and deep.

Now on for Rome l for Rome and glory on 1

For farne or death, Hamilcar's warrior son ἒ

By that great, vengeful oath thy childhood swore ς

By all those vows on Gades’ holy shore '¹‘ 3

When late thy manhood‚ at that giant shrine,

In which the sun-god † holds his rights divine,

The sacred pledge with triple ardour seal'd,

Which Rome shall rue in many a crimson field.

E'en now resistless down each Alpine cleft

Descend the armed floods in lauwine-drift,

And shroud amain the laughing scene beneath

With Murder’s scowl, and Rapine’s smokywreath. . . .

Twin sisters curst of Vict’ry l handmaids dire ἒ

To glut revenge, and flesh the conqu’ror’s ire.

Still victor, still the Carthaginian horde

Waves the red flag, and wields the reeking sword :

How starts yon pine-clad Apennine to see

On Thrasymene’s cheek all glassedly

The Southron armour gleam 1 How shades he
now

With cloud on cloud his winter-scathed brow

Against the scene of blood ‡ Ξ Imperial Rome

Sits hopeleSS‚ nerveleSS, ’neath Bellona's dome :

* “Hannibal Gades profectus, vota Herculi exsolvit.''—-
Liv .

†yThe Phoenician Hercules, usually identified with Baal
or Bel, the god of the universe, of light, and of strength,
among all the Eastern nations of antiquity.
