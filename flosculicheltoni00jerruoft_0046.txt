1 8 RoMEo AND JULIET.

LADY MON. Ο, where is Romeo ?—saw you him
to—day ? “
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BEN. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad3
Where,—underneath the grove of sycamore,
That westward rooteth from the city’s side,—
So early walking did I see your son :
Towards him Ι made 3 but he was ’ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I', measuring his affections by my own,—
That most are busied when they are most alone,-
Pursued my humour, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fied from me.

MON. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs ε
But all so soon as the all-eheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to drav'v
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,

Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself 3
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
