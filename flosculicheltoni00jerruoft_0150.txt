 

1 2 2 ULYSSES.

To sail beyond the sunset and the baths

Of all the western stass, until I die.

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down :

It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles

And see the great Achilles whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides: and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven 3 that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To suive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. ’

ΤΕΝΝγεοΝ.
