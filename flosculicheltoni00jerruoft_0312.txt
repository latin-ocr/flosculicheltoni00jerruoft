BooK XXI.

THE second eve had closed upon their march
Within the Asturian border, and the Moors

Had pitch'd their tents within an open wood
Upon the mountain side. As day grew dim,

, Their scatter'd fires shone with distincter light
Among the treeS‚ above whose top the smoke
Diffused itself, and stain'd the evening sky.

Ere long the stir of occupation ceased,

And all the murmur of the busy host,

Subsiding, died away, as through the camp

The crier from the knoll proclaim'd the hour

For prayer appointed, and, with sonorous voice,
Thriee in melodious modulation full

Pronounced the highest name. “There is no God
But G0d1” he cried,·“ there is no God but God Ξ
Mohammed is the Prophet of the Lord Ξ

Come ye to prayer, to prayer! The Lord is great 1
There is no God but God !'' Thus he pronounced
His ritual form, mingling with holiest truth

The audacious name accurst. The multitude
