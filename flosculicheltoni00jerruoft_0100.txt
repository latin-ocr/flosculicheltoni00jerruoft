1f not to bless us and the land wsthal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing time,
Unto a lineal true derived course.

MAvoR. Do, good my Lord, your citizens entrear
you.

BUCK. Refuse not, mighty Lord, this proffer'd
love.

CATESBY. O make them joyful, grant their lawful
’ suit.

GLo. Alas 1 why would you heap those cares on
me Σ
Ι am unfit for state and majesty :
Ι do beseech you take it not amiss 3
Ι cannot, nor Ι will not, yield to you,

SHAKSPERE.
