=3 78 PROMETHEUS.

His throne yet totters, and beneath him lies'
A giant band, which, doom'd by his decree‚

From Hell's abyss in vaunting thunder eries.
Aloud for vengeance, and shall yet be free—4

H eaven’s best, and noblest kings have fallen, shall
not he ?'' ⁴

Yes, sovereign Zeus shall fall, (albeit he bears

Supreme his sway,) if but thy breast contain

The mystic secret, which alone declares

His empire’s death-doom and declining reign.

Yet must thou steel thine heart to bear the pain

His vengeful hand prepares, without a groan 3

Thine only chance to free thee from thy chain :

Thrice hath he ask’d, and thrice thy silence
shown

The cold disdain that tells far more than words can

own.

But hark Ξ what distant moaning strikes the ear!

The mountain breeze dies fitfully and fast,

(Dea th-fraught the stillness) it but hovers near

To gain fresh terrors for the coming blast.

Ocean is startled, and in silence glass’d .

Hath lain his bissows, whilst a sable pall ⁷

Hangs o'er the earth, as though it deem'd the
last y .

F ell throe would rise anon to scatter all, ,Α

Man, Ocean} Earth, and Heaven‚ blent in⁴ one

mighty fall.
