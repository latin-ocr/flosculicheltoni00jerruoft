1 06 HYPERION.

Of influence benign on planets pale,

Of admonitions to the winds and seas,

Of peaceful sway above man's harvesffing,

And all those acts which Deity supreme

Doth ease its heart of love in. I am gone

Away from my own bosom z I have left

My strong identity, my real self,

Somewhere between the throne and where I sit, -

Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search 1

Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round

Upon all space : space starr’d‚ and lorn of light :

Space region'd with life-air and barren void :

Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell,

Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest

A certain shape or shadow, ,making way

With wings or chariot fieree, to repossess

A heaven he lost erewhile : it must-it must

Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King, -

Yes, there must be a golden victory ;

There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets
blown ’

Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival

Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,

Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir

Of strings in hollow shells ; and there shall be

Beautiful things made new, for the surprise

Of the sky-children ε Ι will give command.''
