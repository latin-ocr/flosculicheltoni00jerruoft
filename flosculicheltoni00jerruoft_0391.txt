GREECE.

“ Cold is the beart, fair Greece, that looks on thee
Nor seels as lovers o'er the dust they loved ;
Cold is the eye that will not weep to see
Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed.'⁷
CHILDE HAROLD.

O 'mou that erst upon the wide world’s throne
In queenly majesty didst reign alone 3
That o’er Earth's realms, involved in darkest
night,

Didst pour the radiance of thy noontide light 3
Whose glory glancing down the stream of time
Still beams as bright as in that glory's prime 3
To thee, O Greece, I strike my trembling lyre,
For loftier theme ne’er kindled minstrel’s fire.

And shall the muse adventurous dare to raise
Unequal notes of rapture in thy praise?
To sing the clime, beneath whose listening skies
Immortal melodies were wont to rise Ρ
To hang a wreath upon the arch of Fame
Ages have rear'd eternal to thy name?
Oh, clime of elimes, within thine every glade
With lingering steps the sacred Nine have stray’d 3
