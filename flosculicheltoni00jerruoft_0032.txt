4 FIRST PART OF KING HENRY VI.

BUR. Either she hath bewitch'd me with her
words,
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.

PUC. Besides all French and France exclaims on ,

thee,
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation,
Who will not trust thee but for profit's sake Ρ
When Talbot hath set footing once in France,
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
Who then, but English Henry, will be lord,
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
Call we to mind‚—and mark but this, for proof 3—
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
And was he not in England prisoner?
But when they heard he was thine enemy,
They set him free, without his ransom paid‚
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
See then! thou fight’st against thy countrymen,
And join'st with them will be thy slaughter-men.
Come, come, return 3 return, thou wandering Lord 3
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
