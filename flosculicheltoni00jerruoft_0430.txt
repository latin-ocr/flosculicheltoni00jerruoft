402 BELISARIUS.

And lustrous bank of forest precipice.

Oft when in youth, on sunlit mountain lawns‚
All eagle-eyed Ι pierced the boundless blue‚

Or, tranced beside the ever roaring sea,

Gazed on the wind-born sheets of ragged foam --
Ι felt my greatsoul struggle in my breast

And pulse me onward unto larger deeds,

And slowly shoot into the perfect man.

But when Ι read of heroes, Homer-sung,
God-men, who far on plains of Pergamus

Strode, triple arm'd in panoply all gold,

Nor fear’d to cope with warrior deities,

But drove them bleeding to the splendrous heights
Of many-peak’d Olympus whence they came-—

Ι too, Ι said, will be a warrior chief,

And marshal hosts to death or victory,

And will be great among the sons of men.

“ So I arose, and girt myselfwfor light,
And was a soldier of the Emperor.
Then step and step Ι rose through great exploits,
Until men hail’d me General of the East.
Then when on Dara rush’d the Persian host,
Elate in pride of fancied victory,
I met them, warden of the city gates—
I fought, I conquer’d, I deserved my honour—-
Not less than they who strove in days of old
Along far foam-girt Marathonian fields,
And check'd the march of Eastern despotism,
And drove back Xerxes to his paradise,
