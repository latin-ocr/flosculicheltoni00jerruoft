THE PRAISE OF LABOUR. =3²93

Toil——the leading star of nations‚
Toil- the birthright of the world,
Leading on through all temptations‚
Earthy fogs around us curPd,
Onward over many a river,
Onward over forest-glade,
Where for ever and for ever
Gleams the greenwood-colonnade‚
Where the untasted spring is welling,
Where amid o’ershading trees
Unknown birds are fondly telling
Unheard secrets to the breeze ε >
s Learn, thou old untrodden mountain,
Learn, thou ancient, moss-grown soil,

Verdant valley‚ crystal fountain‚
The nobility of Toil ἔ

Leave to spear and leave to sabre
Wasted lands and cities sack'd,
Labour spans the rivers—Labour
Bridges o'er the cataract Ξ
T hrough the dark of forests olden‚
By the Saxon's hatchet true,
Labour bids—-in splendour golden
Heaven's blue eye peeps brightly through.

By the steam-ship onward dashing‚
By the hundred-handed mill,

By the magic engine flashing
Every motion of the will,
