PARADISE LOST
BOOK II.

EITHER to disenthrone the King of Heaven

We war, if war be best, or to regain

Ourown right, lost : him to unthrone we then

May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield

To fickle chance, and Chaos judge the strife z

The former ‘vain to hope argues as vain

The latter ,- for what place can be for us

Within Heaven’s bound, unless Heaven's Lord
supreme

We overpower? Suppose he should relent,

And publish grace to all, on promise made

Of new subjection 3 with what eyes could we

Stand in his presence humbhe, and receive

Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne

With wairbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing

F orced hallelujahs 3 while he lordly sits

Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes

Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,

Our servile offerings ? This must be our task

In Heaven 3 this our delight ε how wearisome
