.3 68 . GREECE.

Ah no 2 Destruction rode upon the breeze
That lured those warriors through the yielding- seas;
And grimly hovering round their billowy way,
Impatient Ruin mark'd them for his prey.
Champions of Freedom 1 glory's best loved race!
Your triumph still glad memory would retrace!
Still your high deeds with Grecia's hallow'd name
Shall live recorded in the rolls of fame 1
N ever shall fade the conquering wreath ye won
Upon the plains of glorious Marathon 1

And when vindictive Xerxes sought to efface
His country's stern defeat, his sire's disgrace 3
When steel-clad millions march'd at his behest,
And millions yet upon their footsteps prest3
When e'en exhausted streams before them fied,
And Famine stalk’d behind their wasting tread ,·
Again, for Freedom bade her, Hellas rose
And humbled in the dust her baffled foes.
Yet was that far-famed triumph dearly gain'd 3
With Valour's blood the victor's crown was stain’d3
Brave Thespia's heroes, Sparta's dauntless band,
Their lives devoted to preserve their land
To sacred Athens the destroyer came,
And kindled there the devastating flame.
F ierce was the struggle—bright the victory,
For Persia's might was qu ell'd and Greece was free ἕ
So darkly round th’ approaching orb of day
The clouds of night o’erhang in dense array 3
So fly those clouds before his rising might, ·
And Nature triumphs in a flood of light.
