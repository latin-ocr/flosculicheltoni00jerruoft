3 1 2 MACBETH.

LADY M. My w0rthy lordss
Your noble friends do lack you.

MACB. I do forget :- ·
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends 3
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to

all 3 ,

Then I'll sit down :—give me some wine, fill full 3-—
1 drink to the general joy of the whole table, , .
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss 3

Would he were here 1 To all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.

SHAKSPERE.
