386 CA RTHAGE.

Their various waters blend at length in one

Black yeasty gulf—a boiling Phlegethon.

With wrangling brawl the sable masses meet,

With welcome stern the sable masses greet 3

The plunging surge still spurns the foamy rein,

And champs the bit, and shakes its bristling mane :

So curbs their rage the all-prevailing tide,

Bends their wild stream, and shapes their course of
, Ρήόε3

Till on at length the mingled columns sweep

In one broad flood careering through the deep.

“ Harkl heard ye not the baying dogs of war?
Flares not on high his blood-red meteor star?
Beheld ye not his dragons' reeking breath
Tinge earth's pure veins with gory hues of death *Ρ
Aye l well may havoc whet his thirsty steel l
For many a life his fellest throes must feel,

When Carthage' warriors eye with fierce disdain
The Roman eagle brooding o’er the plain

From tall Saguntum’s hill —the massy throne

Of conscious strength congealed into stone.'’
Through fair Italia's glades such whispers ran,

As portents darken'd 'neath the augur’s scan3

And horror curdled in each lab'ring meast,

To view pale woe in Myst’ry’s mantle drest. .

Nor vain those fears z—too soon the locust band
Flings its dread shadow o'er the death-doom’d land ;

* Vid. Livy passim, for an account of the prodigies that
ushered in the Punic invasion.
