382 CARTHAGE.

When on old Atlas' head in crimson hues

The god of gladness sheds his mute adieuS.

The shepherd's tent looks meekly at the sky,
His lonely flocks in mournful silence lie,

Where many a hall and many a proud arcade,
With wealth of Araby and Ind array'd,

F ull back to heaven the sun’s bright glances flung,
And wreaths of fragrance on the breezes hung ε ,
Where oft erewhile the slumb'ring echoes woke
To the soft music of the boatman’s stroke,

Who, speeding nightly on his homeward way,
Sang to the silent moon his joyous roundelay.

Love’s fairy Queen, sweet Peri of the sky,
Peeping, oh 1 loveliest, with half-shut eye
’Tween the cloud-curtains of the mazy west,
The spangled mantle of the day-king's rest—
Oft hast thou seen along thine own blue tide
Carchedon’s fearless barks all lonely 'ride 3
Oft tempest-toss'd 'mid pathless seas afar
Carchedon's sons have hail’d thy beacon star,
When wing'd with speed they sought our island

home *,

Woo’d onward by “the wild-bird's wish to roam.’'
Proud sight it was and glorious, to survey,
As time roll'd on, and lustres stream’d away,

* The Phoenicians, according to Strabo, sailed to the
Cassiterides‚ now the Scilly Islands, and the coast of Corn·

wall ; bringing thence tin ore, and keeping their voyage from
Gades a secret from all other nations. '
